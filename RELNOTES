This is gimp-print version 4.1.0, the initial development on the 4.1 line.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers.  The support for printers in GhostScript and CUPS is
identical to the support for these printers in the Print plugin --
they use the identical code base.  Please read Ghost/README and
CUPS/README.txt for more information on this.

This plugin can be compiled against either Gimp 1.1 or 1.0.

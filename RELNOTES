This is the Print plugin for the Gimp, version 3.1.5.  This is a
development release.  If this software causes your print head to zoom
off the end of your printer, spilling ink all over your 1000 year old
Persian rug, don't blame us.  Remember, you installed the software.

This software also comes with a GhostScript driver for Epson Stylus
printers.  The support for Epson Stylus printers in the GhostScript
driver is identical to the support for these printers in the Print
plugin -- they use the identical code base.

This plugin can be compiled against either Gimp 1.1 or 1.0.


Print 3.1.5 contains the following improvements over Print 3.1.4:

1) Greatly improved print quality.  In particular, ordered dithering
   and adaptive dithering methods are now much better than ever
   before.  We recommend ordered dithering for four-color printers and
   either adaptive hybrid or adaptive random dithering for six-color
   printers.

2) If a print job is canceled from within the Gimp, the partial file
   will not be sent to the printer.

3) Support for additional Canon and Hewlett-Packard printers.

4) Epson Stylus printers can now print much closer to the edge of the
   page.  They can print to the extreme top edge and much closer to
   the bottom than before, although there is some loss in quality
   close to the edge.

5) Greatly improved black quality.

6) The preview window now shows the borders of the printable area in
   addition to the borders of the page.  In addition, the offsets are
   now from the true edge of the page rather than from the edge of the
   printable area.

7) 720 dpi highest quality and 1440x720 dpi highest quality are now
   supported on the new generation Epson printers.

8) Epson printers will now print faster on sparse pages and in pure
   black and white.  This is of particular interest for the
   Ghostscript driver.


Print 3.1.4 contains the following improvements over Print 3.1.3:

1) Support for the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 960.

2) Print quality improvements.

3) Some print speed optimizations.

4) Major fix for hybrid Floyd-Steinberg dithering


Print 3.1.3 contains the following improvements over Print 3.1.2:

1) Completely revamped dithering algorithms.  These algorithms should
   be faster and easier to maintain in addition to better,
   particularly on more advanced printers.  There are additional
   choices for dithering algorithms: an ordered dither, and two kinds
   of Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion.  There are also adaptive error
   diffusion algorithms, in which ordered dithering is used in certain
   circumstances.

2) The user interface has been heavily revamped.  There are currently
   two options, one based on the Gimp native toolkit and one based on
   GTK.  Depending upon user feedback, one will be withdrawn at some
   point.

4) Support for additional Hewlett-Packard printers and media.

3) Bug fixes for Epson printers, the GhostScript driver, and many
   other things.


Print 3.1.2 contains the following improvements over Print 3.1.1:

1) Better dither quality.

2) Dither is optimized for several different types of images
   (photographs, continuous-tone images such as charts, line art, and
   very fast pure black/white rendering).

3) Tweaking of the GhostScript driver.

4) Epson Stylus Color 440 prints in softweave.  In general, most Epson
   printers are more reliable.

5) Preliminary support for more Hewlett-Packard printers.



Print 3.1.1 contains the following improvements over Print 3.1.0:

1) Faster dithering speed.

2) Improved support for many Epson Stylus printers.

3) Some UI improvements.

4) Numerous bug fixes.


Print 3.1.0 contains the following user-visible improvements over
Print 3.0.5, the version distributed with the Gimp 1.1.17:

1) Preliminary support for Canon BubbleJet printers (specifically the
   BJC6000).

2) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Color 440/640/740/900 and
   Stylus Photo 750/1200 printers.  These printers should in theory
   work in all modes, although that has not been comprehensively
   tested.  1440 dpi mode on the 900 in particular may not work.
   There is also pre-preliminary support for the Stylus Photo 870 and
   1270 based on the published specifications.  This driver is
   completely untuned for these printers at present.

3) Ability to position the image on the page to the point (1/72", or
   about .35 mm), along with a more accurate depiction of the
   positioning on the page.

4) One-click ability to scale to the image resolution (Gimp 1.1 only).

5) Much better handling of the saved state (printrc file), including
   saving of parameters related to file output.

6) Utilities (in various states of completion) to reconstitute an
   image from a print file.

7) Bug fixes for density in indexed and gray modes, and for excess
   pseudo-black printing in general.

There are additional improvements over Print 2.0.2 (the version
distributed with Gimp 1.1.11 and earlier) too numerous to list here.

<h1>Gimp print FAQ</h1>

<h2>Is it only for Gimp?</h2>

<p>Gimp-print started out as a driver for The Gimp, the well known
image manipulation program.  Early in development versions for
Ghostscript and later CUPS were added.  The emphasis is still on
quality color printing, though performance gets a lot of attention
these days.
 
<h2>I cannot install it, it complains about missing Gimp files</h2>

<p>You need to have Gimp development files installed on your system.
These are called gimp-devel-something.rpm on most systems.

<h2>What is the difference between B/W, Line art, solid color and
Photo mode (or ImageType in Ghostscript)?</h2>

<p>Photo mode does a lot of work to make colors as similar to screen
presentation as possible.  This takes time. The other modes are
faster, but colors may be off.  B/W mode does not use color ink when
printing.

<h2>I selected my printer and it doesn't work at all</h2>

<p>Please check your printing system (lp/lpr, etc.) configuration.

<h2>I selected the right printer and nonsense gets printed</h2>

<p>Printers for which support just has been added may not have been
tested, as the developers do not have access to the printer. It is
worth trying different settings. For example, change the resolution to
a mainstream value as used on that printer. Also photo mode is better
tested than the optimized versions. When you find out what works and
what doesn't, file a bug report.

<p>One common cause of this is not using "raw" mode when printing from
the Gimp plugin.  Depending upon your printing system, you will need
to use either -l (traditional BSD lpd), -oraw (CUPS lpr), or -d (most
versions of System V lp).  Otherwise the printing system attempts to
interpret the output as something else, and tries to apply a filter to
it.
  
<h2>What's up with the HP Deskjet 1200?</h2>

<p>HP had sold two printers with the 1200 model designation. The old
version is 300 DPI and has a heating element to dry the ink. It was
manufactured around 1990.  The new version is of 2000 vintage has has
higher resolution.  The one supported by this package is the new
one???

<h2>I selected selected the right printer and the quality is lousy</h2>

<p>Try selecting a different resolution or quality setting. Especially
lower resolutions have a problem putting enough ink on paper. Also,
use Photo mode.  If you find settings that do not work, report these
as bugs.  High resolutions should produce a similar (but smoother)
result than medium resolutions. Resolutions under a certain printer
dependent figure are seen as draft-only - for example lower than 360
DPI on Epsons with standard paper or lower than 300 DPI on HP.

<p>If you use Ghostscript, make sure the Ghostscript resolution is not
set higher than the driver resolution. If it is higher, the driver has
to throw away part of the pixels, leading to uneven strokes in text
and slanted lines with interruptions.

<h2>What is 'interpolated' resolution?</h2>

<p>Interpolated resolution is an experimental way of simulating higher
resolution than the printer offers by calculating the result at high
resolution but printing at the maximum resolution offered by the
printer.  In our experience, when the dither algorithm is working
properly this merely results in longer processing time and more
voluminous output with little or no improvement in quality.

<h2>How do I start setting options for Ghostscript?</h2>

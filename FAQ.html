<h1>Gimp print FAQ</h1>

<h2>Is it only for Gimp?</h2>
Gimp-print started out as a driver for The Gimp, the well known image
manipulation program.
Early in development versions for Ghostscript and later CUPS were added.
The emphasis is still on quality color printing,
though performance gets a lot of attention these days.
 
<h2>I cannot install it, it complains about missing Gimp files</h2>
You need to have Gimp development files installed on your system.
These are called gimp-devel-soomething.rpm on most systems.

<h2>What is the difference between B/W, Line art, solid color and Photo mode?</h2>
Photo mode does a lot of work to make colors as similar to screen
presentation as possible.
This takes time. The other modes are faster, but colors may be off.
B/W mode does not use color ink when printing.

<h2>I selected my printer and it doesn't work at all</h2>

<h2>I selected the right printer and nonsense gets printed</h2>
Printers for which support just has been added may not have been tested,
as the developers do not have access to the printer. It is worth trying
different settings. For example, change the resolution to a mainstream
value as used on that printer. Also photo mode is better tested than the
optimized versions. When you find out what works and what doesn't, file
a bug report.
  
<h2>What's up with the HP Deskjet 1200?</h2>
HP had sold two printers with the 1200 type designation. The old version is
300 DPI and has a heating element to dry the ink. It was manufactured
around 1990.
The new version is of 2000 vintage has has higher resolution.

<h2>I selected selected the right printer and the quality is lousy</h2>
Try selecting a different resolution or quality setting. Especially lower
resolutions have a problem putting enough ink on paper. Also, use Photo mode.
If you find settings that do not work, report these as bugs.
High resolutions should produce a similar (but smoother) result than
medium resolutions. Resolutions under a certain printer dependent figure are
seen as draft-only - for example lower than 360 DPI on Epsons or lower than
300 DPI on HP.

If you use Ghostscript, make sure the Ghostscript resolution is not set
higher than the driver resolution. If it is higher, the driver has to throw
away part of the pixels, leading to uneven strokes in text and slanted lines
with interruptions.

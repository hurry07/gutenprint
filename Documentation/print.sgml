  <para>
    The main window is divided into five panes:
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Preview</guilabel></term>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>Preview</guilabel> pane contains a
	    <guibutton>positioning widget</guibutton> that allows
	    interactively positioning the output on the page. It
	    contains an outer border, representing the sheet of paper;
	    an inner border, representing the printable area of the
	    printer; an arrow, pointing to the top of the page (the
	    end that's fed into the printer); and a black rectangle,
	    representing the position of the image on the page. The
	    image can be moved around on the paper. When the first
	    (<mousebutton>left</mousebutton>) button is used, the
	    image is moved in screen pixels; when any other button is
	    used, the image is moved in points<footnote><para>the
	    output resolution of the plugin</para></footnote>. The
	    arrow resizes depending upon the media size chosen; the
	    shaft of the arrow is always equal to one inch on
	    the output.
	  </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Printer Settings</guilabel></term>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>Printer Settings</guilabel> pane contains a
	    dropdown menu for selecting a printer to print to. There
	    is a special <quote>printer</quote> named File that allows
	    you to choose a file to print to, rather than a printer
	    queue. The <guilabel>Setup</guilabel> box to the right
	    allows specification of a printer type, a PPD
	    file<footnote><para>for Postscript
	    printers</para></footnote>, and the command to be used to
	    print. Each distinct printer in the
	    <guibutton>Printer</guibutton> list can have different
	    settings applied to it. Below that is a <guibutton>combo
	    box</guibutton> allowing choice of media size. The choices
	    are constrained to those that the printer supports.  Below
	    that are <guibutton>dropdown</guibutton> menus for
	    choosing media type (what kind of paper), media source
	    (what input tray), ink type, and resolution.  All of these
	    settings are printer-specific.

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Position</guilabel></term>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>Position</guilabel> pane contains various
	    widgets to place the image on the paper. These widgets
	    work in conjunction with the <guilabel>Preview</guilabel>
	    pane. At the top left of the pane is a button to center
	    the image on the paper (not on the printable area). To its
	    right is a <guibutton>button group</guibutton> that allows
	    choosing English (inch) units or metric (centimeter)
	    units. Below these are <guibutton>four boxes</guibutton>
	    that allow entry of the left, top, right, and bottom of
	    the image. These positions are relative to the top left of
	    the paper<footnote><para>again, that's relative to the
	    paper corner, not the printable area, which is usually
	    smaller</para></footnote>.  There are two additional boxes
	    that allow specification of the right margin and bottom
	    margin if you prefer; these are relative to the bottom
	    right corner of the paper. Any of these may have values
	    entered into them; the preview image will be moved
	    appropriately. <note><para>These entries do not resize the
	    image.</para></note> Finally, there is a pick box for
	    <guibutton>orientation</guibutton> (landscape or
	    portrait).  There is an <guibutton>Auto</guibutton> mode
	    that picks the orientation that yields the orientation
	    that best matches that of the image to be printed.
	  </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Scaling</guilabel></term>  
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>Scaling</guilabel> pane contains a slider
	    that allows scaling of the image. The image can be scaled
	    in either percent of the printable area (NOT the page in
	    this case) or pixels per inch (<acronym>PPI</acronym>) via
	    a <guibutton>radio button</guibutton> below the slider.
	    <acronym>PPI</acronym> allows matching image resolution to
	    printer resolution.  The image may be scaled using either
	    method to between 5 and 100% of the imageable area. It is
	    not possible to crop with the Print plugin. In
	    <guibutton>Percent</guibutton> mode, the image is scaled
	    so that neither axis will be longer than the percent of
	    the printable area specified. For example, if you print an
	    image at 20%, it will be possible to tile the image 5
	    times on one axis and at least 5 times on the other. To
	    the right of the radio button is a button called
	    <guibutton>Set Image Scale</guibutton>. This sets the
	    scaling to <acronym>PPI</acronym>, and sets the resolution
	    as closely as possible to the resolution stored in the
	    image. To the right of the <guibutton>Set Image
	    Scale</guibutton> button are two boxes that allow entry of
	    <guibutton>width</guibutton> and
	    <guibutton>height</guibutton> of the image. These set the
	    scaling mode to <acronym>PPI</acronym>.  Specifying one
	    automatically sets the other, and the image is
	    repositioned as needed to prevent it from falling off the
	    edge of the page.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
	
      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Image Settings</guilabel></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>Image Settings</guilabel> pane allows choice
	    of <guibutton>Line Art</guibutton>, <guibutton>Solid
	    Colors</guibutton>, <guibutton>Photograph</guibutton>, or
	    <guibutton>Monochrome</guibutton> image type. Line art or
	    Solid Colors should be used for graphics containing mostly
	    solid areas of color. They're very similar to each other.
	    Photograph mode dithers more slowly, but produces more
	    accurate colors. Finally, Monochrome mode can be used to
	    print absolute black and white very quickly. To the right
	    of these four radio buttons is a button called
	    <guibutton>Adjust Color</guibutton>. This pops up a new
	    window that controls various output quality settings. That
	    will be described separately. Finally, there is a choice
	    of Black and White and Color output.

      <varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Action Buttons</guilabel></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The last pane contains four action buttons:

	    <itemizedlist> 
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  <guibutton>Print and Save Settings</guibutton>
		  &mdash; immediately print the image (or, if the File

		  pick the output file), and save all current settings
		  for all printers.

	      </listitem>
	     
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  <guibutton>Save Settings</guibutton> &mdash;
		  immediately save the settings, and continue working
		  in the Print plugin.
  	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	     
	      <listitem>
	        <para>

		  print the image (or, if the File printer is chosen,
		  display a file selection window to pick the output
		  file), but do not save settings.
 	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	     
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> &mdash; immediately
		  quit without saving or printing.

    </variablelist> 
  </para>
  
  <sect2 id="adjust-color">
    <title><guibutton>Adjust Color</guibutton></title>
    <para>
      The Adjust Color button button pops up a non-modal dialog that
      allows adjustment of various parameters related to the print
      quality. These are independent of the controls within the
      <application>GIMP</application> itself and only affect the
      print.

      At the top of the window is a thumbnail of the image that
      changes to reflect the color settings of the image.  This
      enables you to get an idea of how the image will print out as
      you adjust settings.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
      Below that there are eight sliders:
      
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Brightness (0-2.0, default 1.0)</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the brightness of the image.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	  
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Contrast (0-4.0, default 1.0)</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the output contrast.

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	  
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (0-4.0, default 1.0)
	    </guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the cyan, magenta, and yellow in the output.
	      These should not normally need to be adjusted very much;
	      even very small adjustments can go quite a long way to
	      restoring color balance..
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	  
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Saturation (0-9.0, default 1.0)
	    </guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the color brilliance (saturation) of the output.
	      Saturation of 0 means pure gray scale, with no color.
	      Saturation of 9.0 will make just about anything but
	      pure grays brilliantly colored.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	  
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Density (0.1-2.0, default 1.0)
	    </guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the density (amount of ink) in the print. The
	      density is automatically corrected for the particular
	      printer, resolution, and in some cases paper choices.
	      If solid black in the input is not solid in the print,
	      the density needs to be increased; if there is excessive
	      ink bleed-through and muddy dark colors, the density
	      should be decreased. <note><para>that the density will not
	      increase beyond a certain amount no matter what the
	      slider is set to.</para></note>
	    </para>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Gamma (0.1-4.0, default 1.0)
	    </guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      adjust the output gamma. The gamma value is
	      automatically corrected for the choice of printer; this
	      is used if you believe the automatic setting is
	      incorrect.
	    </para>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guilabel>Dither Algorithm</guilabel></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      There is also a selection box for the <guilabel>dither
	      algorithm</guilabel> to be used. There are currently seven choices:
	      <itemizedlist>
	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    Adaptive Hybrid usually yields the best output
		    quality; it chooses a modified Floyd-Steinberg
		    error diffusion algorithm or ordered dithering
		    depending upon the image characteristics.
		  </para>
	        </listitem>

	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    Ordered uses a pure ordered dither. It generally
		    yields excellent quality for simple black and
		    white or four color printers without variable drop
		    size or drop modulation; it is not recommended if
		    high quality is desired on six color printers.  It
		    is considerably faster than Adaptive Hybrid.
		  </para>
	        </listitem>
		    
	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    Fast also uses a pure ordered dither, but uses a
		    very simple black model and makes no attempt to
		    handle multi-level (6-color, variable drop size,
		    or drop modulation) at all cleanly. It is
		    substantially faster than Ordered dither. The
		    quality tends to be quite poor except on simple
		    four color printers. On three color printers,
		    quality is probably competitive with anything
		    else.
		  </para>
	        </listitem>
		    
	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		   Very Fast is similar to Fast, except that it uses a
		   very simple dither matrix that can be looked up
		   much more quickly than the matrix used in the Fast
		   dither.  For simple pure black and white images
		   dominated by horizontal and vertical lines, this
		   may actually yield the best results; for other
		   types of image, the quality will be poor.
		  </para>
	        </listitem>
		    
	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    Adaptive Random is similar to Adaptive Hybrid,
		    except that the modifications to the
		    Floyd-Steinberg algorithm are slightly different.
		    This is slower than Adaptive Hybrid on most
		    systems.  For some images the quality may be
		    better than Adaptive Hybrid, but generally
		    Adaptive Hybrid should yield slightly superior
		    images.
		  </para>

	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg uses the modified
		    Floyd-Steinberg algorithm of Adaptive Hybrid on
		    the entire image.  Generally, the results are poor
		    in pale regions.

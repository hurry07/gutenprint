<H3>The Main Window</H3>

<img src="main.png">

<P>The main window is divided into five panes: <P></P><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"><DL><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Preview</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Preview</SPAN> pane contains a
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">positioning widget</SPAN> that allows
	    interactively positioning the output on the page. It
	    contains an outer border, representing the sheet of paper;
	    an inner border, representing the printable area of the
	    printer; an arrow, pointing to the top of the page (the
	    end that's fed into the printer); and a black rectangle,
	    representing the position of the image on the page. The
	    image can be moved around on the paper. When the first
	    (<SPAN
CLASS="MOUSEBUTTON">left</SPAN>) button is used, the
	    image is moved in screen pixels; when any other button is
	    used, the image is moved in points<A
NAME="AEN14"
HREF="#FTN.AEN14">[1]</A>. The
	    arrow resizes depending upon the media size chosen; the
	    shaft of the arrow is always equal to one inch on
	    the output.
	  </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Printer Settings</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Printer Settings</SPAN> pane contains a
	    dropdown menu for selecting a printer to print to. There
	    is a special <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE">"printer"</SPAN> named File that allows
	    you to choose a file to print to, rather than a printer
	    queue. The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Setup</SPAN> box to the right
	    allows specification of a printer type, a PPD
	    file<A
NAME="AEN24"
HREF="#FTN.AEN24">[2]</A>, and the command to be used to
	    print. Each distinct printer in the
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Printer</SPAN> list can have different
	    settings applied to it. Below that is a <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">combo
	    box</SPAN> allowing choice of media size. The choices
	    are constrained to those that the printer supports.  Below
	    that are <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">dropdown</SPAN> menus for
	    choosing media type (what kind of paper), media source
	    (what input tray), ink type, and resolution.  All of these
	    settings are printer-specific.
	  </P></DD>
<center><img src="setup.png"></center>

<DT><SPAN CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Position</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Position</SPAN> pane contains various
	    widgets to place the image on the paper. These widgets
	    work in conjunction with the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Preview</SPAN>
	    pane. At the top left of the pane is a button to center
	    the image on the paper (not on the printable area). To its
	    right is a <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">button group</SPAN> that allows
	    choosing English (inch) units or metric (centimeter)
	    units. Below these are <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">four boxes</SPAN>
	    that allow entry of the left, top, right, and bottom of
	    the image. These positions are relative to the top left of
	    the paper<A
NAME="AEN38"
HREF="#FTN.AEN38">[3]</A>.  There are two additional boxes that allow
	    specification of the right margin and bottom margin if you
	    prefer; these are relative to the bottom right corner of
	    the paper. Any of these may have values
	    entered into them; the preview image will be moved
	    appropriately. <DIV
CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"><P><B>Note: </B>These entries do not resize the
	    image.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV> Finally, there is a pick box for
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">orientation</SPAN> (landscape or
	    portrait).  There is an <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Auto</SPAN> mode
	    that picks the orientation that yields the orientation
	    that best matches that of the image to be printed.
	  </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Scaling</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Scaling</SPAN> pane contains a slider
	    that allows scaling of the image. The image can be scaled
	    in either percent of the printable area (<strong>not</strong> the page in
	    this case) or pixels per inch (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM">PPI</SPAN>) via
	    a <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">radio button</SPAN> below the slider.
	    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM">PPI</SPAN> allows matching image resolution to
	    printer resolution.  The image may be scaled using either
	    method to between 5 and 100% of the imageable area. It is
	    not possible to crop with the Print plugin. In
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Percent</SPAN> mode, the image is scaled
	    so that neither axis will be longer than the percent of
	    the printable area specified. For example, if you print an
	    image at 20%, it will be possible to tile the image 5
	    times on one axis and at least 5 times on the other. To
	    the right of the radio button is a button called
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Set Image Scale</SPAN>. This sets the
	    scaling to <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM">PPI</SPAN>, and sets the resolution
	    as closely as possible to the resolution stored in the
	    image. To the right of the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Set Image
	    Scale</SPAN> button are two boxes that allow entry of
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">width</SPAN> and
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">height</SPAN> of the image.  Specifying one
	    automatically sets the other, and the image is repositioned as
	    needed to prevent it from falling off the edge of the
	    page.
	  </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Image Settings</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">Image Settings</SPAN> pane allows choice
	    of <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Line Art</SPAN>, <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Solid
	    Colors</SPAN>, <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Photograph</SPAN>, or
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Monochrome</SPAN> image type. Line art or
	    Solid Colors should be used for graphics containing mostly
	    solid areas of color. They're very similar to each other.
	    Photograph mode dithers more slowly, but produces more
	    accurate colors. Finally, Monochrome mode can be used to
	    print absolute black and white very quickly. To the right
	    of these four radio buttons is a button called
	    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Adjust Color</SPAN>. This pops up a new
	    window that controls various output quality settings. That
	    will be described separately. Finally, there is a choice
	    of Black and White and Color output.
	  </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Action Buttons</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	    The last pane contains four action buttons:

	    <P></P><UL><LI><P>		  <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Print and Save Settings</SPAN>
		  &#8212; immediately print the image (or, if the File
		  printer is chosen, display a file selection window to

  </P><DIV
CLASS="SECT2"><H3
CLASS="SECT2"><A
NAME="ADJUST-COLOR"><SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON">Adjust Color</SPAN></A></H3><P>      The Adjust Color button button pops up a non-modal dialog that
      allows adjustment of various parameters related to the print
      quality. These are independent of the controls within the
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION">GIMP</SPAN> itself and only affect the
      print.
    </P>
<center><img src="color.png"></center>
<p>At the top of the window is a thumbnail of the image that changes
to reflect the color settings of the image.  This enables you to get
an idea of how the image will print out as you adjust settings.

<P>      Below that are eight sliders:
      
      <P></P><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"><DL><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Brightness</b> (0-2.0, default 1.0)</SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the brightness of the image.
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Contrast</b> (0-4.0, default 1.0)</SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the output contrast.
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Cyan</b>, <b>Magenta</b>, <b>Yellow</b> (0-4.0, default 1.0)
	    </SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the cyan, magenta, and yellow in the output.
	      These should not normally need to be adjusted very much;
	      even very small adjustments can go quite a long way to
	      restoring color balance..
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Saturation</b> (0-9.0, default 1.0)
	    </SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the color brilliance (saturation) of the output.
	      Saturation of 0 means pure gray scale, with no color.
	      Saturation of 9.0 will make just about anything but
	      pure grays brilliantly colored.
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Density</b> (0.1-2.0, default 1.0)
	    </SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the density (amount of ink) in the print.  The
	      density is automatically corrected for the particular
	      printer, resolution, and in some cases paper choices.
	      If solid black in the input is not solid in the print,
	      the density needs to be increased; if there is excessive
	      ink bleed-through and muddy dark colors, the density
	      should be decreased. <DIV
CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"><P><B>Note: </B>that the density will not
	      increase beyond a certain amount no matter what the
	      slider is set to.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Gamma</b> (0.1-4.0, default 1.0)
	    </SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      adjust the output gamma. The gamma value is
	      automatically corrected for the choice of printer; this
	      is used if you believe the automatic setting is
	      incorrect.
	    </P></DD><DT><SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"><b>Dither Algorithm</b></SPAN></DT><DD><P>	      There is also a selection box for the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL">dither
	      algorithm</SPAN> to be used. There are currently seven choices:

<ul>

<p><li><b>Adaptive Hybrid</b> generally yields the best output quality;
it chooses a modified Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm or an
ordered dither depending upon the image characteristics.

<p><li><b>Ordered</b> uses a pure ordered dither.  It generally yields
excellent quality for simple black and white or four color printers
without variable drop size or drop modulation; it is not recommended
if high quality is desired on six color printers.  It is considerably
faster than Adaptive Hybrid.

<p><li><b>Fast</b> also uses a pure ordered dither, but uses a very
simple black model and makes no attempt to handle multi-level
(6-color, variable drop size, or drop modulation) at all cleanly.  It
is substantially faster than Ordered dither.  The quality tends to be
quite poor except on simple four color printers.  On three color
printers, quality is probably competitive with anything else.

<p><li><b>Very Fast</b> is similar to Fast, except that it uses a very
simple dither matrix that can be looked up much more quickly than the
matrix used in the Fast dither.  For simple pure black and white
images dominated by horizontal and vertical lines, this may actually
yield the best results; for other types of image, the quality will be
poor.

<p><li><b>Adaptive Random</b> is similar to Adaptive Hybrid, except that
the modifications to the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm are slightly
different.  This is slower than Adaptive Hybrid on most systems.  For
some images the quality may be better than Adaptive Hybrid, but
generally Adaptive Hybrid should yield slightly superior images.

<p><li><b>Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg</b> uses the modified Floyd-Steinberg
algorithm of Adaptive Hybrid on the entire image.  Generally, the
results are poor in pale regions.

<p><li><b>Random Floyd-Steinberg</b> uses the modified Floyd-Steinberg
algorithm of Adaptive Random on the entire image.  Generally, the
results are poor in pale regions.
</ul>

<p>Finally, there are buttons to set all sliders to their default
values, and to dismiss this dialog.

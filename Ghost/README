PROGRAM:
--------

 Driver for Epson, Canon, and PCL printers based on the gimp-print
 plugin.  This driver is capable of producing very high quality 4 and
 6 color prints.


AUTHOR:
-------

 This Ghostscript frontend is written by
 Henryk Richter (buggs@comlab.uni-rostock.de).

 Uses the gimp-print core by Michael Sweet (mike@easysw.com) and
 Robert Krawitz (rlk@alum.mit.edu).

 Currently maintained by the Gimp-Print development team
 (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net).

INSTALLATION AND COMPILATION:
-----------------------------

 - If you downloaded a CVS snapshot of this software, this directory
   will not include many of the source files that are generated from
   the gimp-print source.  To create these files, you must run the
   following commands from the parent directory:

   aclocal
   autoconf
   automake
   ./configure
   make ghost

   If this fails (because you do not have the Gimp or any of the
   autoconfigure tools installed on your system), you can use the
   configure script from any release, and run

   configure --disable-gimptest
   make ghost

 - Get a recent Ghostscript (5.10 or better) and prepare the sources as
   described in the documentation (don`t forget zlib, libpng and libjpeg
   when downloading the source) for compiling

 - Copy all "*.c" and "*.h" files to the "src/" subdirectory of ghostscript's
   distribution.

 - If you are using Ghostscript 5.50 or newer: edit the file
   "contrib.mak" in the "src/" subdirectory by adding the contents of
   "contrib.mak.addon"

 - If you are using Ghsotscript 5.10: edit the file "devs.mak" in the
   "src/" subdirectory by adding the contents of "devs.mak.addon-5.10".

 - Add "$(DD)stp.dev" to the line "DEVICE_DEVS6=..." in "unix-gcc.mak"

 Compile and install gs as described in the documentation, after a
 successful compiler run you got a new driver named "stp". Check 
 this by calling "gs -h" with the newly compiled ghostscript.

Debian users can try the following (contributed by Stuart Miles):
versions are current as of 12th August 2000:

Download the debianised sources for gs-aladdin and libjpeg:

# apt-get source gs libjpeg

(Make sure you have a deb-src entry in /etc/apt/sources.list first!
See the sources.list(5) man page for more info on setting up apt.)

This will download the .dsc, orig.tar.gz and diff.gz files, unpack and
patch the files for you.

Rename the libjpegxxx (currently libjpeg62) directory to libjpeg.

To compile gs you _may_ also need the following installed:

zlib1g-dev_1%3a1.1.3-5_i386.deb
svgalibg1-dev_0.96-5_i386.deb
libpng0-dev_0.96-5_i386.deb
vflib2-dev_2.25.1-4_i386.deb

or their current equivalent.

Under the gs contrib directory make an stp subdir and copy in the
gdevstp* files, copy in the README file and rename it README.stp, in
the same directory you'll also need a contrib.mak.addon file.

Under the gs/debian directory is a file called rules, this file is a
script which controls the compilation of gs and the building of the
debian package, this needs to be amended to add the actions required
to build the stp driver. Copy the debian-patch file into the /debian 
directory and use this file to patch the /rules and /control files.
Copy the debian-patch-stp file to /debian/patches and rename the file
/stp.

Once all the files are in place go into the gs directory and:

# debian/rules binary

The script will copy the sourcefiles and README.stp into the main gs
directory, patch contrib.mak, add the stp entry to unix-gcc.mak,
compile gs, package it all up as a .deb package
(gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb) and put the resulting file in the directory
above gs.

To install it:

# dpkg -i gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb

NB.
#include <standard disclaimers>

This is not an official Debian package.  This method works for at
least one person.  To be really neat and tidy other files need
modifying to ensure that this custom package gets marked as such and
_not_ an official package.



OPTIONS:
--------

 Options for the stp driver are given in normal ghostscript
 manner. The resolution of the image calculated by ghostscript is not
 bound to the resolution of the printer output. It is for example
 possible to specify "-r360" to gs and print the output in 1440x720
 dpi (see below for driver parameter). The result is a somewhat faster
 operation of the driver.

Most or all of the Epson Stylus printers are fully functional.  The
others vary.  In particular, all of the listed Epson Stylus Photo
printers print in full 6-color photo mode; most of the others do not.
The color output has also been better tuned for Epson Stylus printers
than for others.


Print Resolution Selection:
----- ---------- ----------

The meaning of this is model-specific.

For Epson Stylus printers:

-sQuality='

'180 DPI'				 (works on older printers)
'360 DPI'                                (works on all printers)
'360 DPI Softweave'                      (works on printers that support
					  variable dot sizes, such as
					  the Epson Stylus Color 740
					  and newer)
'360 DPI High Quality'                   (works on printers that support
					  variable dot sizes, such as
					  the Epson Stylus Color 740
					  and newer)
'720 DPI Microweave'                     (works on older printers)
'720 DPI Softweave'                      (works on all printers except
					  for Stylus Color, Stylus
					  Color 1500, Stylus Color
					  1520, and Stylus Color 3000)
'720 DPI High Quality'                   (works on all printers except
					  above and Epson Stylus Color
					  440/460/480)
'720 DPI Highest Quality'                (works on all printers except
					  above and Epson Stylus Color
					  440/460/480)
'1440 x 720 DPI Microweave'              (works on older 1440x720 dpi printers)
'1440 x 720 DPI Softweave'               (works on all 1440x720 dpi
					  printers except for Stylus
					  Color 1520 and Stylus Color 3000)
'1440 x 720 DPI Highest Quality'         (works on all 1440x720 dpi
					  printers except for Stylus
					  Color 1520 and Stylus Color 3000)
'1440 x 1440 DPI Emulated'               (works on all 1440x720 dpi
					  printers except for Stylus
					  Color 1520 and Stylus Color 3000)
'1440 x 2880 DPI Emulated'               (works on all 1440x720 dpi
					  printers except for Stylus
					  Color 1520 and Stylus Color 3000)

The last two modes use oversampling to emulate higher resolutions than
the printers actually support.  In some cases they may yield improved
output quality, but they are slower than the lower resolution modes.
The other 1440x720 modes use the printer in different ways to to
achieve different tradeoffs of quality vs. performance; likewise with
the 720 DPI modes.

The Microweave modes are extremely slow on many printers.  Not all
printers can do Microweave properly, particularly at 1440x720 DPI.  If
Microweave is used with these printers, the printing will be done one
row at a time.  In addition to being extremely slow (but often
extremely high quality), this may be harmful to the print head and may
cause clogging, due to ink pooling in the print head.  If your printer
is capable of non-Microweave modes, there is seldom any advantage to
be had from using Microweave.

In general, using resolutions lower than 720 DPI on coated paper will
yield unsatisfactory results.


For PCL printers (including Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark):

'150x150 DPI'
'300x300 DPI'
'600x300 DPI'
'600x600 DPI monochrome'
'600x600 DPI'
'1200x1200 DPI'
'2400x1200 DPI'


For Canon printers:

1200 DPI printers (BJC 7000, BJC 7100, BJC 8200, BJC 8500):

'300x300 DPI'
'300x300 DPI DMT'
'600x600 DPI'
'600x600 DPI DMT'
'1200x600 DPI'
'1200x1200 DPI'

1440 DPI printers (BJC 1000, BJC 2000, BJC 3000, BJC 4300,
    BJC 4400, BJC 5100, BJC 5500, BJC 6000, BJC 6100, BJC 6500):

'180x180 DPI'
'360x360 DPI'
'360x360 DPI DMT'
'720x360 DPI'
'720x720 DPI'
'1440x720 DPI'
'1440x1440 DPI'


Dithering Algorithms:
--------- -----------

-Dither='algorithm'

'Adaptive Hybrid'
'Ordered'
'Adaptive Random'
'Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg'
'Random Floyd-Steinberg'

Hybrid algorithms use error diffusion, but a matrix is used when a
random number is required.  Adaptive algorithms use error diffusion
except in very light regions, where ordered dithering is used.

Ordered dithering typically works best in solid-color graphics on four
color printers, and in very pale regions.  The results on six color
printers tend to be poor.  The adaptive algorithms do perform well on
six color printers.

Adaptive hybrid dithering usually gives the best results overall.


Ink Types
--- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.
Not all ink types are supported on all printers.

-sInkType='ink type'


For Epson printers:

Six color printers can print using four color inks or all six colors.
Six color mode is recommended for photographs.  Four color mode may be
useful when printing text with embedded graphics to reduce ink
consumption.

'Six Color Photo'
'Four Color Standard'


For Canon printers:

'Black'
'Color'
'Black/Color'
'Photo/Color'
'Photo'


For PCL (Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark) printers:

'Color + Black Cartridges'
'Color + Photo Cartridges'


Media Types
----- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.

-sMediaType='media type'


For Epson printers:

'Plain Paper'
'Plain Paper Fast Load'
'Postcard'
'Glossy Film'
'Transparencies'
'Envelopes'
'Back Light Film'
'Matte Paper'
'Inkjet Paper'
'Photo Quality Inkjet Paper'
'Photo Paper'
'Other'


For Canon printers:

'Plain Paper'
'Transparencies'
'Back Print Film'
'Fabric Sheets'
'Envelope'
'High Resolution Paper'
'T-Shirt Transfers'
'High Gloss Film'
'Glossy Photo Paper'
'Glossy Photo Cards'
'Photo Paper Pro'


For PCL (Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark) printers:

'Plain'
'Bond'
'Premium'
'Glossy/Photo'
'Transparency'
'Quick-dry Photo'
'Quick-dry Transparency'


Media Sources
----- -------

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.

-sMediaSource='media source'

No media sources are currently defined for Epson printers.  At
present, only the single sheet feeder can be used.


For Canon printers:

'Auto Sheet Feeder'
'Manual with Pause'
'Manual without Pause'


For PCL (Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark) printers:

'Manual'
'Tray 1'
'Tray 2'
'Tray 3'
'Tray 4'
'Portable Sheet Feeder'
'Desktop Sheet Feeder'
'Tray'
'Tray 2'
'Optional Source'
'Autoselect'



Image type (to optimize the dither):
----- ---- --- -------- --- --------

-dImageType=x x:   0 ...   3  (0)
Select the image type most representative of what's being printed.  

0  Line art (color or gray scale)
1  Primarily solid colors or smooth gradients (color or gray scale)
2  Continuous-tone photographs (color or gray scale)
3  Pure black and white or pre-screened (currently black only)

For mixed documents, options 0 or 1 will probably work best.  Option 0
will dither faster and yield sharper text, but images will be
grainier.  Option 1 will yield smoother images, but text will not be
as sharp and the dither process will be slower.  Option 2 will yield
the best natural images, but is quite slow.  Option 3 is very fast and
accurate, but should not be used if there are any tones other than
pure black and white.


EXAMPLES:
---------

Example 1 (print charts to file, color, 360 dpi):
gs -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-ex -dDensity=1.6 -dGamma=1.5 -dSaturation=0.9 \
   -dBrightness=40 -dImageType=1 -sOutputFile=itsyourchoice.prn foo.ps

Example 2 (print color photograph to /dev/lp0 at maximum quality):
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-870 -dDensity=0.8 \
   -r1440x720 -sQuality='1440 x 720 DPI Highest Quality' -dImageType=2 \
   -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 foo.ps

Example 3 (print pure black text to stdout)
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-660 -dDensity=0.8 -r720 \
   -sQuality='720 DPI Softweave' -dImageType=3 -sOutputFile=- foo.ps


PDQ AND CUPS
------------

The PDQ driver declaration in file gs-stp.pdq can be used with PDQ
(http://feynman.tam.uiuc.edu/pdq/) to give a nice control panel for
this driver.  To use it, put the file somewhere, and add a try_include
"filename" clause to your ~/.printrc file.  Then run xpdq and select
Printer->Add Printer.

The PPD file com-stp.ppd can be used with CUPS.

http://www.linuxprinting.org/~gtaylor/howto/

A new, experimental printer configuration method may be found at the
following locations, depending upon the printing method that you
currently use:

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
---------------------

- This driver is relatively slow, and memory-hungry with large paper
  sizes and high quality settings.
- In some cases (the Epson Stylus Color 850 is a known example), the
  top margin on the paper will be somewhat wider than desired
  (typically by about 1 cm or 3/8").  This is more likely to happen
  with older printers.

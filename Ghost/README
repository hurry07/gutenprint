Installation and Compilation:
-----------------------------

 - If you downloaded a CVS snapshot of this software, this directory
   will not include gdevstp-escp2c, gdevstp-print.h, gdevstp-util.c,
   or gdevstp-dither.c.  To create these files, you must run the
   following commands from the parent directory:

   aclocal
   autoconf
   automake
   ./configure
   make ghost

   If this fails (because you do not have the Gimp or any of the
   autoconfigure tools installed on your system), please download the
   latest release snapshot from gimp-print.sourceforge.net.
 - Get a recent Ghostscript (5.5 or better) and prepare the sources as
   described in the documentation (don`t forget zlib, libpng and libjpeg
   when downloading the source) for compiling
 - copy "gdevstp-escp2.c", "gdevstp-print.h", "gdevstp-util.c",
   "gdevstp-dither.c", "gdevstp-printers.c, "gdevstp.c" and
   "gdevstp.h" to the "src/" subdirectory of ghostscript`s
   distribution.
 - edit the file "contrib.mak" in the "src/" subdirectory by adding
   the contents of "contrib.mak.addon"
 - add "$(DD)stp.dev" to the line "DEVICE_DEVS6=..." in "unix-gcc.mak"

 Compile and install gs as described in the documentation, after a
 successful compiler run you got a new driver named "stp". Check 
 this by calling "gs -h" with the newly compiled ghostscript.

Debian users can try the following (contributed by Stuart Miles):

Download the debianised sources for gs-aladdin and libjpeg:

# apt-get source gs-aladdin libjpeg

(Make sure you have a deb-src entry in /etc/apt/sources.list first!
See the sources.list(5) man page for more info on setting up apt.)

This will download the .dsc, orig.tar.gz and diff.gz files, unpack and
patch the files for you.

Rename the libjpegxxx directory to libjpeg.

Under the gs contrib directory make an stp subdir and copy in the
gdevstp* files, copy in the README file and rename it README.stp, in
the same directory you'll also need a contrib.mak.diff file. I'll have
to send that to you seperately, I'm at work at the moment and don't
have the files with me.

BTW, I had to modify your contrib.mak.addon by stripping out all the
$(DD) parts, I also removed the $(DD) from the unix-gcc.mak entry, I
don't know what they tie up with in your version of the source but
they don't match anything in mine.

Under the gs/debian directory is a file called rules, this file is a
script which controls the compilation of gs and the building of the
debian package, this needs to be amended to add the actions required
to build the stp driver. Again, I'll have to send you a copy of the
file tonight, I'll also include a .diff against the original.

Once all the files are in place go into the gs directory and:

# debian/rules binary

The script will copy the sourcefiles and README.stp into the main gs
directory, patch contrib.mak, add the stp entry to unix-gcc.mak,
compile gs, package it all up as a .deb package
(gs-aladdin_5.50-8.deb) and put the resulting file in the directory
above gs.

To install it:

# dpkg -i gs-aladdin_5.50-8.deb

NB.
#include <standard disclaimers>

What I've done works for me, to be really neat and tidy other files
need modifying to ensure that this custom package gets marked as such
and _not_ an official package. 



Options:
--------


 Options for Stylus Photo Printer driver are given in normal
 ghostscript manner. The resolution of the image calculated by
 ghostscript is not bound to the resolution of the printer output. It
 is for example possible to specify "-r360" to gs and print the output
 in 1440x720 dpi (see below for driver parameter). The result is a
 somewhat faster operation of the driver.


Color Balancing Values: (min,max,default)
----- --------- ------- -----------------

-dRed=xxx        xxx:   0 ... 200  (100)
-dGreen=xxx      xxx:   0 ... 200  (100)
-dBlue=xxx       xxx:   0 ... 200  (100)
-dBrightness=xxx xxx:   0 ... 400  (100)
-dContrast=xxx   xxx:  25 ... 400  (100)
-dGamma=xxx      xxx: 0.1 ... 3.0  (1.0)
-dDensity=xxx    xxx: 0.1 ... 2.0  (1.0)
-dSaturation=xxx xxx: 0.1 ... 9.0  (1.0)
-dColor=x          x:   0 ...   1  (1) (0==gray, 1==color) 


Printer Model Selection:
------- ----- ----------

-dModel=xx

0   Stylus Color
1   Stylus Color Pro/Pro XL/400/500
2   Stylus Color 1500
3   Stylus Color 600
4   Stylus Color 800

14  Stylus Photo 750/870
15  Stylus Photo 1200/1270
16  Stylus Photo 860
17  Stylus Color 1160

Note that not all printers are fully functional yet.

Print Resolution Selection:
----- ---------- ----------

-dQuality=x

0  360 DPI                               (works on all functioning printers)
1  720 DPI Microweave                    (works on all functioning printers)
2  720 DPI Softweave                     (works on most printers)
3  720 DPI High Quality                  (works on most printers)
4  720 DPI Highest Quality               (works on most printers)
5  1440 x 720 DPI Microweave             (works on selected printers)
6  1440 x 720 DPI Softweave              (works on selected printers)
7  1440 x 720 DPI Highest Quality        (works on selected printers)
8  Emulated 1440 x 1440 DPI              (works on selected printers)
9  Emulated 2880 x 720 DPI               (works on selected printers)

Modes 8 and 9 use oversampling to emulate higher resolutions than the
printers support.


Dithering Algorithms:
--------- -----------

-dDither=x

0  Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg
1  Ordered
2  Random Floyd-Steinberg
3  Adaptive Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg
4  Adaptive Random Floyd-Steinberg

Hybrid algorithms use error diffusion, but a matrix is used when a
random number is required.  Adaptive algorithms use error diffusion
except in very light regions, where ordered dithering is used.

Ordered dithering typically works best in solid-color graphics.

Perturbed ordered is similar to ordered, except that the matrix is
"twisted" to break up the fine diagonal lines characteristic of the
matrix used.  This option is generally less smooth than the ordered
dither option, but in some cases it may yield better results.


Currently supported Media Selection:
--------- --------- ----- ----------

(important: always use lower case names)

-sPAPERSIZE=letter
-sPAPERSIZE=legal
-sPAPERSIZE=a4
-sPAPERSIZE=a3


Image type (to optimize the dither):
----- ---- --- -------- --- --------

-dImageType=x x:   0 ...   3  (0)
Select the image type most representative of what's being printed.  

0  Line art (color or gray scale)
1  Primarily solid colors or smooth gradients (color or gray scale)
2  Continuous-tone photographs (color or gray scale)
3  Pure black and white or pre-screened (currently black only)

For mixed documents, options 0 or 1 will probably work best.  Option 0
will dither faster and yield sharper text, but images will be
grainier.  Option 1 will yield smoother images, but text will not be
as sharp and the dither process will be slower.  Option 2 will yield
the best natural images, but text will be noticeably fuzzy.  Option 3
is very fast and accurate, but should not be used if there are any
tones other than pure black and white.


Examples:
---------

Example 1 (print charts to file, color, 360 dpi):
gs -sDEVICE=stp -dModel=8 -dDensity=0.7 -dGamma=1.5 -dSaturation=0.9 -dBrightness=40 -dImageType=1 -sOutputFile=itsyourchoice.prn foo.ps

Example 2 (print color photograph to /dev/lp0 at maximum quality):
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -dModel=6 -dDensity=0.8 -r1440 -dQuality=6 -dImageType=2 -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 foo.ps

Example 3 (print pure black text to stdout)
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -dModel=6 -dDensity=0.8 -r720 -dQuality=2 -dImageType=3 -sOutputFile=- foo.ps


Settings you might try:
-----------------------

720dpi, plain paper, original Epson ink:
-dQuality=3 -dDensity=0.7 -dRed=105 -dGreen=90 -dBrightness=110


PDQ and CUPS
------------

The PDQ driver declaration in file gs-stp.pdq can be used with PDQ
(http://feynman.tam.uiuc.edu/pdq/) to give a nice control panel for
this driver.  To use it, put the file somewhere, and add a try_include
"filename" clause to your ~/.printrc file.  Then run xpdq and select
Printer->Add Printer.

The PPD file com-stp.ppd can be used with CUPS.

Bugs and Limitations:
---------------------

- The top margin is too large.
- The escp2 driver isn`t optimized at the moment so be patient when trying
  the 720 and 1440x720 dpi color modes.

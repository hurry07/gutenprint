Installation and Compilation:
-----------------------------

 - Get a recent Ghostscript (5.5 or better) and prepare the sources as
   described in the documentation (don`t forget zlib, libpng and libjpeg
   when downloading the source) for compiling
 - copy "gdevstp-escp2.c", "gdevstp-print.h", "gdevstp-util.c",
   "gdevstp-dither.c" "gdevstp.c" and "gdevstp.h" to the "src/"
   subdirectory of ghostscript`s distribution
 - edit the file "contrib.mak" in the "src/" subdirectory by adding
   the contents of "contrib.mak.addon"
 - add "$(DD)stp.dev" to the line "DEVICE_DEVS6=..." in "unix-gcc.mak"

 Compile and install gs as described in the documentation, after a
 successful compiler run you got a new driver named "stp700". Check 
 this by calling "gs -h" with the newly compiled ghostscript.


Options:
--------


 Options for Stylus Photo Printer driver are given in normal ghostscript
 manner. The resolution of the image calculated by ghostscript is not 
 bound to the resolution of the printer output. It is for example possible
 to specify "-r360" to gs and print the output in 1440x720 dpi (see below
 for driver parameter). The result is a somewhat faster operation of the driver.

Examples:
---------

Example 1 (print to file, color, 360 dpi):
gs -sDEVICE=stp -sOutputFile=itsyourchoice.prn -dModel=8 -dDensity=0.7 -dGamma=1.5 -dSaturation=0.9 -dBrightness=40 foo.ps


Example 2 (print to /dev/lp0, color, 720 dpi HQ Mode):
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -sOutputFile=- -dModel=6 -dDensity=0.8 -r720 -dQuality=4 >/dev/lp0 foo.ps


Settings you might try:
-----------------------

720dpi, plain paper, original Epson ink:
-dQuality=3 -dDensity=0.7 -dRed=105 -dGreen=90 -dBrightness=110


Bugs and Limitations:
---------------------

- In softweave modes (2,3,4,5,6,7) there is a bigger top margin (by 0.36 inch = 9.6 mm).
- I experienced some problems with pure grayscale printing (-dColor=0) with
  my Photo 700 printer where the escp2 driver didn`t add linefeeds to 
  the output code in softweave modes.
  Workaround1: -dSaturation=0.1 and -dColor=1 (side effect: less grainyness due to 6 color
               prints)
  Workaround2: -dQuality=0 , 1 or 5 in conjunction with -dColor=0
  Workaround3: For fast operation with pure b/w or grayscle images such as
               texts try the "uniprint" driver.
- All printers except Photo700 and all paper sizes other than DIN A4 are 
  untested.
- The escp2 driver isn`t optimized at the moment so be patient when trying
  the 720 and 1440x720 dpi color modes.

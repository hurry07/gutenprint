This is the Print plug-in for the Gimp, version 3.1.8 (development).

To build and install:

./configure
make
make install

This is a development release, and as such, not all printers or
combinations of options will work.  Please check our web site at
http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net for details about what is and is not
supported.

If you have installed the Gimp as a precompiled package (e. g. from an
RPM), you will need to install the gimp-devel package as well as the
gimp package.  The gimp package as supplied in most distributions only
contains what's needed to run the Gimp.  The gimp-devel package
contains additional files required to actually build new plugins.

If you have installed the Gimp from source on Linux: after running
make install, you must run ldconfig as root before attempting to build
this plugin.

Please report problems to gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net.


For developers, prior to running configure, you must

aclocal;autoconf;automake

If you do run aclocal, beware that versions of the Gimp from 1.1.17
and earlier have a version of gimp.m4 that will create an incorrect
configure script.  The patch is as follows:

diff -u /usr/local/share/aclocal/gimp.m4~ /usr/local/share/aclocal/gimp.m4

If you are building this from a release, you should not have any
trouble because the configure script will already exist.

Enjoy!

This is the Print plug-in for the Gimp, version 3.1 (development).

To build and install:

./configure
make
make install

For developers, prior to running configure, you must

aclocal;autoconf;automake

If you do run aclocal, beware that versions of the Gimp from 1.1.17
and earlier have a version of gimp.m4 that will create an incorrect
configure script.  The patch is as follows:

diff -u /usr/local/share/aclocal/gimp.m4~ /usr/local/share/aclocal/gimp.m4

If you are building this from a release, you should not have any
trouble because the configure script will already exist.

Enjoy!

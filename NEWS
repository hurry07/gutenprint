Gimp-Print 4.3.3, released July 14, 2002, is a development release of
this package.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers, including Foomatic data.

The Gimp Print plugin requires the Gimp 1.2.

The CUPS driver requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher.  1.1.14 or above is
highly recommended, as certain translation-related bugs are fixed and
it is possible to print true CMYK.

The Ghostscript driver requires Ghostscript 5.50, 6.51, or any later
GNU Ghostscript release based on 6.51 (e. g. 6.52).

The IJS GhostScript plugin driver requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or later
or APFL GhostScript 7.04 or later.

Please read the README file for full instructions on building and
installing this package.

Gimp-Print 4.3.3 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.3.2:

1) Printing at very low vertical resolution (typically less than 360
   DPI; 360 DPI itself is fine) in black and white mode on some Epson
   printers either failed or produced incorrect results.  This bug has
   been present for a while.

2) Quad tone grayscale inks, such as the Piezography (TM) inks, are
   now supported for most Epson Stylus printers.  This is not tuned
   for a particular inkset at this time, so the results will not be of
   top quality yet.

3) The Gimp Print plugin will now compile properly on commercial UNIX
   systems that do not have the asprintf function (which is
   libc-specific).

4) Various improvements to EvenTone dithering.

5) The Epson Stylus Photo 2100 and 2200, and 7600 and 9600, should now
   print correctly in seven color mode (for UltraChrome inks).


Gimp-Print 4.3.2 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.3.1:

1) A failure in the CUPS installation has been fixed.

2) The Even Tone dither algorithm now produces correct colors in CMYK
   mode.


Gimp-Print 4.3.1 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.3.0:

1) A crash that happened in stp_vasprintf on many systems has been
   fixed.

2) A crash in the IJS driver when printing extremely large images,
   such as banners on a wide format printer at high resolution, has
   been fixed.

3) A portability issue in gimpprint-config has been fixed.

4) An installation problem with the CUPS PPD files on systems lacking
   an appropriate install script has been fixed.

5) Partial translations for German, Spanish, and Portuguese have been
   added.

6) The option to *not* build the Gimp-Print library (libgimpprint) has
   been removed.

7) The escputil alignment command has been improved.

8) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Photo 950 and 2100/2200,
   and the Stylus Pro 7600 and 9600.  The Stylus Photo 950 has been
   verified and partially tuned.  The other printers are untested and
   may or may work.

9) Quality improvements to the Even Tone dither algorithm.

10) The printer data in the Epson driver has been substantially
   reorganized.  This allows the driver to support the new UltraChrome
   inks (for the Stylus Photo 2100/2200 and Stylus Pro 7600 and 9600).
   This will also permit the driver to support quadtone or hextone
   grayscale inks, although that capability is not enabled at present.

11) The testpattern generator has some improvements, including the
   ability to print 16-bit images.  The image format is not
   documented, as this is likely to change, but people may wish to
   study the code and experiment with it.


Gimp-Print 4.3.0 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.2.1:

1) A new dithering algorithm, EvenTone, is supported.  EvenTone
   screening was invented by Raph Levien, and produces noticeably
   superior results particularly for continuous tone images such as
   photographs.  EvenTone dithering produces a slight "waterfall"
   effect which may render it unsuitable for line art and graphics
   using extremely pale tones on some printers.

2) Significant reorganization of the internal interfaces between the
   family drivers, the dither code, and the weave code, to enable an
   arbitrary number of subchannels (rather than just 2 each of CMY and
   1 K).

3) Reorganization of the build system to use automake 1.6 and autoconf
   2.52.


Supported Printers:

Many variations on these printers are also supported.  Generally, the
Epson printers are fully supported, although not fully tuned in all
cases; the Canon, HP, and Lexmark printers vary.  Many printers
previously supported have greatly improved support.

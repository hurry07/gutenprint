This is gimp-print version 4.1.5, a development release on the 4.1 line.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers.  The support for printers in GhostScript and CUPS is
identical to the support for these printers in the Print plugin --
they use the identical code base.  Please read Ghost/README and
CUPS/README.txt for more information on this.

The Gimp Print plugin requires the Gimp 1.2.

Gimp-Print 4.1.5 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.4:

1) A "bar-code" effect on certain HP printers (all printing looks like
   something vaguely resembling a bar code) is now fixed.

2) The maximum paper dimensions for many Epson printers (particularly
   older ones) is fixed.  In particular, all printers can now print
   44" long or better, the Stylus Color Pro, Pro XL, 400, and 500 can
   now print 13" wide, and the Stylus Photo EX can print A3-sized
   paper.

3) Clean up the Debian packaging a bit more.  In particular, the
   Debian installation files are included in the release.

4) Bug fixes for the Epson 480/580.

5) Fix printing dimensions for Epon 780/790, 890, and 1280/1290 to
   allow printing to all edges.

6) Significant quality improvements for Epson printers printing to
   plain paper.  The noticeable effects should be more solid blacks
   and colors.  There may be a bit more ink bleed, but it should not
   be wildly excessive.

   Users of 6-color (Stylus Photo) printers may find that using Four
   Color Standard ink gives better results on plain paper.  There will
   be less ink bleed and more consistent grays, at the expense of
   smoothness of pale tones.

7) A significant rewrite of some of the internals, while having no
   effect on the behavior of the package, will ultimately permit a
   much more stable binary interface.  Currently, this is in an
   interim state.

8) A major print quality problem slipped into many new Epson printers
   in 4.1.4, resulting in pale (and in some cases distorted) output in
   many printing resolutions.  That is fixed.

9) Provisional quality fixes for the Canon BJC-8200.


Gimp-Print 4.1.4 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.3:

1) Major improvements to the Debian packaging.  It is compliant with
   Standards-Version 3.1.1, and is lintian-clean.  It should build
   from source on potato, woody and sid.  Please see the README for
   more information.

2) First cut at internationalization.  Please see the README for more
   information.

3) The Ghostscript driver should now compile on all systems.

4) Added support for Epson 83 printer (appears to be more or less a
   clone of the 880), Stylus Photo 1280, and Stylus Photo 480/580.
   Note: it is still not possible to change ink cartridge on the
   480/580 with this driver.

5) Initial support for the Compaq IJ750 (aka Lexmark 3200) and Lexmark
   Z31.

6) Initial support for Canon BJC6500, S400, S450, S800, and S4500.

7) Some improvements in quality for the Epson Stylus Color 900/980.

8) Fix for Set Image Scale in GUI when image scaling was previously in
   percent mode.

9) Other minor UI improvements.

10) Print correctly in grayscale mode when the source resolution is
   better than the output resolution.  This bug manifested itself as
   printing an image squashed, usually with the other 2/3 of it black.

11) Some improvements in the Lexmark driver.

12) Fix for print width of Epson Stylus Photo 2000P (it can print to
   13" wide).

13) Tune page length for a number of Epson printers (should eliminate
   problem of printing off the end of the page).

14) New 180x120 and 360x120 DPI modes for Epson printers that cannot
   print 180x180 DPI.  These modes are for very quick and dirty
   economy printing; they will not print solid black even on plain
   paper.

15) New gimpprint-config script (with man page) to ease linking
   against libgimpprint.

16) Significant print quality improvements for many variable dot size
   printers.

17) Cleaned up some black speckling problems.

18) New --disable-libgimpprint option to configure inhibits building
   of libgimpprint.  This can be used to build just the programs (GIMP
   plugin and/or CUPS driver) against an installed copy of
   libgimpprint (if the installed copy is current).


Print 4.1.3 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.2:

1) The source has been completely reorganized.  Please read the README
   file for more information!

2) Improvements to the Lexmark driver.


Print 4.1.2 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.1:

1) We believe this release contains an important bug fix that in some
   cases caused the Epson driver to seg fault upon completion.  This
   resulted in the page being slightly incomplete at the bottom, and
   in addition the page was not ejected.

2) Further improvements in quality (we believe) in Photograph mode.

3) Correct sizing for extremely tiny images in the Print plugin.

4) First cut at roll feed printing for the Epson Stylus Photo
   870/1270.

5) Support for custom paper sizes in the Print plugin.

6) Initial support for the Lexmark 3200, and other improvements in the
   Lexmark driver.

7) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Photo 790/890/1290
   (followons to the 870/1270).

8) Fixes to the Debian installation.

9) Preliminary support for the Canon BJC-55 and BJC-85.

10) The Ghostscript Makefile snippets now contain a proper dependency
   on gdevstp-print.h.

11) Many internal changes to prepare for a major code reorganization
   that is coming up shortly.  These changes should be completely
   invisible at user level.


Print 4.1.1 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.0:

1) Further improvements in quality (we believe) in Photograph mode.

2) A problem whereby black letters and other black detail had a hollow
   appearance under some circumstances is fixed.

3) The Canon S450 is now supported.

4) The Epson Stylus Color 640 and 660 should print correctly.

5) escputil now uses readline when available.


Print 4.1.0 contains all fixes through the 4.0.4 release.  In
addition, it contains the following user-visible differences over
Print 4.0.4:

1) Greatly improved color quality in Photograph mode.  In particular,
   red, green, blue, and violet colors are much more accurate.  This
   is done by means of hue and luminosity adjustments based on input
   hue and saturation.  This only works in Photograph mode; Line Art
   and Solid Colors have not changed.

2) Preliminary support for the Lexmark Z52 inkjet printer.

3) Support for 2880x720 on Epson Stylus printers that support that
   resolution.  The visible quality difference will probably be little
   if any.

4) Fine black detail in color mode is greatly improved.

5) Many new resolutions have been added for Epson Stylus printers,
   mostly supporting better print quality at 180, 360, and 720 DPI.

6) There is preliminary support for 600x600 C-RET mode on the HP 840.

7) The foomatic package is not currently being distributed with
   gimp-print.  The main issue is synchronizing the foomatic database
   with the rapidly evolving state of gimp-print.  We have not
   determined yet whether it will be practical to continue
   distributing foomatic with gimp-print.

8) The PPD's generated as part of the native CUPS driver are
   incompatible with the PPD's in the 4.0 version of the native CUPS
   driver.  This requires reinstalling your printers after running
   'make install' in the cups subdirectory.

9) The defaults with the native CUPS driver are now identical to the
   defaults with the Ghostscript stp driver and the Gimp Print
   plugin.

10) Ordered dithering is now smoother on 6 color printers, at some
   loss of color fidelity.

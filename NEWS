Gimp-Print 4.2.4-pre1, released November 6, 2002, is a prerelease in
the stable Gimp-Print 4.2 series.

Gimp-Print is a suite of printer drivers that may be used with most
common UNIX print spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr, LPRng, or
others.  These drivers provide high quality printing for UNIX
(including Macintosh OS X 10.2 and newer) and Linux systems in many
cases equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied drivers, and
can be used for many of the most demanding printing tasks.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers, including Foomatic data.

The Print plug-in for the requires the Gimp 1.2.

The CUPS driver requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher.  1.1.14 or above is
highly recommended, as certain translation-related bugs are fixed and
it is possible to print true CMYK.

The Ghostscript driver requires GNU Ghostscript 5.10, 5.50, 6.51, or any
later GNU Ghostscript release based on 6.51 (e. g. 6.52).  It may also
be used with GNU Ghostscript 7.05, or with ESP Ghostscript 7.05.

The IJS GhostScript plugin driver requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or
later, ESP Ghostscript 7.05 or later, or APFL GhostScript 7.04 or
later.

Users of Macintosh OS X 10.2 and above can use this package, as the
printing system is based on CUPS, which is supported by Gimp-print.
Note that Macintosh OS X 10.0 and 10.1 (including 10.1.5) cannot use
this package.  We recommend that Macintosh OS X users download the
precompiled installer package from http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net
rather than attempt to build this package from source, as using the
installer is much simpler.  We further recommend that Macintosh OS X
users install ESP GhostScript, to permit printing from Carbon
applications (such as most Adobe applications) that generate
PostScript rather than PDF output.  Directions for that are also
available at http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net.

Please read the README file for full instructions on installing this
package.

Gimp-Print 4.2.4-pre1 contains the following fixes and changes over
Gimp-Print 4.2.3:

  1) Serious color errors with Lexmark printers have been fixed.

  2) An inability of CUPS to print certain page sizes has been fixed.

  3) 6-color HP and Lexmark printers now print correctly.

  4) The Epson Stylus Photo 950, 960, and PM-950C now print correctly
     at 1440x1440 and 2880x720 DPI.  This is not a major fix; these
     resolutions are actually printed at 2880x1440 DPI (which did not
     have problems).  This printer (these are all different names for
     the same printer) is not actually capable of printing at
     1440x1440 or 2880x720 DPI.

  5) Page sizes for some Canon printers have been corrected; A3-format
     printing is now supported on appropriate printers.

  6) Support for the Epson MJ-930C has been added.

The following bugs have been fixed in Gimp-Print 4.2.4-pre1:

628698 Lexmark color reversal
630365 Epson Stylus Photo 950: Enlarged image with some 1440/2800
631498 Canon driver does not support A3 page size for large format

Gimp-Print 4.2.3 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.2.2:


* Major Bugs Fixed:

  1) (bug 604854) The Epson Stylus Color 600, 800, 850, 1520, and 3000
     did not print correctly at 1440x720 DPI (much too dark).  These
     printers now print correctly.

  2) (bugs 620016 and 619992) Two problems with the IJS driver have
     been fixed.  The first problem is that the IJS driver did not
     print correctly in grayscale or monochrome; the second is that a
     spurious fine line was printed at the very top of each page.

  3) (bug 613384) The Epson Stylus Pro 7600 and 9600 did not print at
     all.  While this printer is not fully tuned, it now prints
     correctly.

  4) (bug 621667) Very large prints (longer than about 40" long) on
     Epson Stylus Pro printers were not printed correctly; the print
     is typically chopped into many small pieces.

  5) (bug 615561) The Epson Stylus Color 480 and 580, and C20, C40,
     C41, and C42 (all variants) did not print in black and white or
     grayscale.  This was a regression in 4.2.2.

  6) (bug 611804) The CUPS driver did not compile correctly on many
     platforms other than Linux (this was known to be an issue on
     Solaris and BSD).  This was a regression in 4.2.2.

  7) (bug 625602) The Stylus Pro 5500, 7000, 7500, 9000, and 9500
     printed too light at low resolutions.  In addition, at 1440x720
     some of these printers used an overly-large dot size, resulting
     in more grain than necessary.


* New Functionality:

  1) The native CUPS driver now accepts custom paper sizes with
     printers that permit this (all Epson printers, and most others).
     To use this on the lp or lpr command line, use

     -o PageSize=Custom.300x400

     where 300 and 400 should be replaced by the width and height of
     the page in 1/72" units.

     The width and height can also be specified in inches ("in"), cm,
     or mm.  For example, for 4.5x7.5-inch paper you can specify:

     -o PageSize=Custom.4.5x7.5in

     On Macintosh OS X, custom page sizes may be defined and selected
     through the Print Manager.

  2) The Foomatic interface now accepts custom paper sizes with
     Foomatic 2.0.1.

     This works with all spoolers.  Here are sample command lines for
     all spoolers, for CUPS the syntax is the same as with the native
     CUPS drivers of GIMP-Print and units are again points ("pt" or
     nothing), inches ("in"), cm, and mm:

	CUPS: lpr -o PageSize=Custom.500x750mm bigposter.ps
	LPRng: lpr -Z PageSize=Custom.500x750mm bigposter.ps
	GNUlpr: lpr -o PageSize=Custom.500x750mm bigposter.ps
	LPD: lpr -JPageSize=Custom.500x750mm bigposter.ps
	PPR: ppr -F "*PageSize Custom" -i 500x750mm bigposter.ps
	PDQ: pdq -oPageSize_Custom -aPageWidth=500
		 -aPageHeight=750 -oPageSizeUnit_mm bigposter.ps
	No spooler: directomatic -o PageSize=Custom.500x750mm bigposter.ps

     This works with both the GhostScript "stp" and the IJS interface
     of GIMP-Print.

  3) A Japanese translation has been added.

  4) This release contains an ijsgimpprint package for Debian.


The following bugs have been fixed in Gimp-Print 4.2.3:

604854 QUALITY-Epson 1520 and 3000 print too dark at 1440x720 DPI
611804 rastertoprinter.c fails to compile on Solaris
613384 Epson 7600 no printing
615561 Epson C40UX cannot print in B&W and Gray
615759 360x240 bad horizontal position
619992 IJS driver prints spurious first line

621667 Very large prints on Epson 9500 fail
622612 CUPS driver forbids custom page sizes
625602 QUALITY Pale output on Stylus Pro 7500



Gimp-Print 4.2.2 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.2.1:


* Major Bugs Fixed:

  1) (bug 565092) A Gimp-print driver crash on some systems is fixed.
     Inspection with a debugger would indicate that the crash was in a
     routine named `stp_vasprintf'.  Whether the driver crashed or not
     depended upon the precise system software installed.

  2) (bug 592093) On certain systems primarily in European countries
     (where the locale was set to a non-US value, such as French,
     German, or even UK English), the IJS-based Ghostscript driver did
     not set certain parameters properly.  The most obvious effect was
     that the page size was set incorrectly.

  3) (bug 510185) On certain Epson printer models (primarily the Epson
     Stylus Color 740 and newer) hosted on some Windows systems, the
     last page of jobs was printed incompletely; anywhere between a
     fraction of an inch and half a page would not be printed.  This
     did not affect all printer models, or all Windows-hosted
     printers.  Whether this happened depended upon the exact printer
     model, the version of Windows, and the driver features selected
     on the Windows host (in particular, the status monitor and/or
     bidirectional communication).

  4) (bug 594637) The driver for the Lexmark Z52 crashed in certain
     circumstances.

  5) (bug 600249) On all printers requiring a right margin greater
     than zero (which is most printers), the native CUPS driver
     printed a right margin twice as wide as the margin required by
     the printer.  This resulted in the output being squeezed
     slightly.

  6) (bug 599505) When using the Postscript PS2 output in the GIMP
     Print plugin to print to a CUPS-hosted printer, options selected
     in the PPD file were ignored.

  7) (bug 598341) On certain systems, the GIMP Print plugin did not
     save the printer defaults correctly.  This happened on systems
     where the `lpstat -p -d' command (used to retrieve the list of
     printers available on the system) produces more than one line
     listing each printer.

  8) (bug 554149) The CUPS driver did not install correctly on certain
     commercial UNIX systems, in particular most Solaris systems.

  9) (bug 581446) The driver did not print correctly at certain very
     low resolutions on certain Epson printers in black and white.
     This prevented fast draft printing from working correctly.

  10) (bug 565091) The IJS driver failed to print extremely large
     images (typically very long banners on large format printers).


* New Functionality:

  1) Apple Macintosh OS 10.2 ("Jaguar") is fully supported as of this
     release.

  2) The default optimization level with gcc is now -O2 rather than
     -O.  This improves performance somewhat.

  3) German, Portuguese, and Spanish translations have been added.

  4) Quad tone grayscale inks, such as the Piezography (TM) inks, are
     now supported for most Epson Stylus printers.  This is not tuned
     for a particular inkset at this time, so the results will not be
     of top quality yet.  This capability should be considered beta.

  5) Many new Epson Stylus printers are supported.  Please see the
     complete list of printers at the bottom of these release notes.


* Quality Improvements:

  1) A new dither algorithm, EvenTone, has been added.  This algorithm
     produces superior results for photographs and other
     continuous-tone images, but in its current form it may not be as
     well suited for solid color images and line art.  This algorithm
     should be considered beta.


* Exceptions and Workarounds:

  1) On Macintosh OS X, it is not possible to print directly from
     applications that generate PostScript, such as most Adobe
     applications.  This is because OS X does not include the
     "rastertops" filter required for CUPS to print PostScript files.
     The workaround is to generate a Print Preview, and to print from
     that (Print Preview generates a PDF, which OS X is able to
     print).

     This limitation is not specific to Gimp-Print.  Please check the
     Gimp-Print web site (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) for
     updates and possible fixes.

  2) The Epson PM-950C (Japanese version of the Stylus Photo 950/960)
     does not use the additional dark yellow ink available on that
     printer.

  3) Certain older Epson Stylus printers (the Stylus Color 3000 is
     known; some or all of the 600, 800, 850, and 1520 may also suffer
     this problem; the Stylus Photo 700 and EX do *not*) print much
     too dark at 1440x720 DPI.  This was reported too late in the
     cycle to fix for this release.  The best workaround is to print
     at 720 DPI, which will yield only a minor reduction in print
     quality.


The following bugs have been fixed in Gimp-Print 4.2.2:

510185 Incomplete print to Windows-hosted printers
534059 print dialog - wrong and confusing label (.no translation)
554149 solaris x86 install error
565091 IJS driver fails on very large images
565092 Crash in stp_vasprintf on some systems
581446 Improper printing at very low resolution (Epson)
586960 Gimp Print plugin installs incorrectly on some systems
592093 IJS driver sets page size incorrectly in some non-US locales
594637 Lexmark Z52 driver crash
597964 Epson 660 wrong margins
598341 get_system_printers() problem with duplicate entries
599505 PS2 printing from GIMP broken with CUPS
600249 gimp-print output too narrow in CUPS



Gimp-Print 4.2.1 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.2.0:


* Major Bugs Fixed:

  1) Canon printers should now print with correct scaling at all
     supported resolutions, and the CMYK printers should print with
     optimum quality.  However, the photo printers (which use special
     cartridges with light cyan and magenta inks) are currently unable
     to use the photo cartridges; they are limited to ordinary CMYK
     printing.

  2) The escputil command is translated.

  3) It is now possible to print at all resolutions on large format
     PCL printers.

  4) The Ghostscript driver now prints with the same quality as the
     other drivers at all resolutions on all printers (in 4.2.0, Epson
     printers printed with poor quality at high resolutions).

  5) CUPS PPD files should operate correctly with the Adobe PostScript
     driver (and other PostScript drivers).

  6) Gimp-Print now builds successfully on Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and
     Macintosh OS X.


* New Functionality:

  1) A new driver, based on the IJS architecture, is included in this
     release.  This driver is compatible with GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and
     above, and AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 and above.  IJS is a new
     architecture for Ghostscript drivers; rather than having to build
     the driver into Ghostscript, the driver runs as a separate
     process.  Foomatic data is provided for this driver.

  2) New translations for the Slovak, Greek, and Dutch languages are
     provided.


* Quality Improvements:

  1) Additional tuning has been done for some Epson Stylus printers,
     in particular the Stylus Pro 5500, 7500, and 9500.

  2) Epson Stylus Pro printers can now print to letter size (and
     smaller) paper.

  3) The Very Fast dither algorithm has been sped up in certain cases.

  4) Some quality improvements for the Epson 680/777 driver.


* Exceptions and Workarounds:

  1) If you have built and installed the foomatic-db-gimpprint package
     from any gimp-print 4.2.1-pre* tarball, or from CVS, you will
     need to manually remove it prior to installing the final 4.2.1
     debs.  This is because it has been renamed to
     foomatic-db-gimp-print to match the foomatic naming scheme.
     There is only a guaranteed upgrade path between official releases
     to avoid unnecessary dependency complexities.


The following bugs have been fixed in 4.2.1:

485156 Debian build broken in 4.2.0
488865 escputil isn't translated

Gimp-Print 4.2.0 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.0:


* Major Bugs Fixed from 4.0:

  1) A problem with fine black data printing incorrectly in 4.0 has
     been fixed.

  2) Very small images print correctly in the Gimp plugin.

  3) A number of minor bugs in scaling and positioning in the Gimp
     plugin are fixed.

  4) Printing pure black and white (monochrome) to black and white
     printers now works properly, rather than silently being converted
     to grayscale.

  5) The package prints correctly in grayscale when the source
     resolution is higher than the output resolution.


* General User-Visible Changes:

  1) Many additional printers are supported, including several Lexmark
     printers for the first time.  The list of supported printers is
     at the bottom of this release memo.

  2) Default printing resolutions are 300x300 or 360x360 DPI for all
     printers, rather than the lowest available resolution.  On Epson
     printers, the default 360x360 printing modes are in most cases
     higher quality than the default 360x360 mode in 4.0.

  3) The same defaults for all driver and printer characteristics
     apply to all front ends (the Gimp plugin, the CUPS driver, and
     the Ghostscript driver).

  4) A user's manual (for the CUPS driver and GIMP plugin) is now
     supplied with the package.

  5) A developer's manual is now supplied with the package.  This
     describes how to use the library interface, how to tune printers,
     and other topics.

  6) The package is now internationalized.  Full translations are
     available for Swedish and British English; partial translations
     are currently available for French, Norwegian, Danish, and
     Polish.


* Quality Improvements:

  1) Color accuracy in Photograph and Solid Colors mode is greatly
     improved over 4.0.  This is most noticeable on red, green, blue,
     and violet colors.  Generally, prints should need little if any
     tuning.

  2) Printed images are much smoother (more even) in texture.  This is
     particularly true on 6-color (photo) and variable drop size
     printers.  The transition between light and dark inks in 6-color
     printers should be invisible to the unaided eye at all but the
     lowest resolutions.

  3) In color mode, fine black detail prints much more accurately than
     previously.  Previously, fine black detail typically did not
     print solidly; this was particularly noticeable when printing
     groups of lines at high resolution.

  4) Epson printers support a greater range of resolutions and quality
     settings, from very low resolution draft mode up to 2880x1440 for
     the newest Epson printers.  This offers a full range of
     speed/quality tradeoffs for any printing application.  The
     emulated resolutions in 4.0 have been dropped, as they do not
     yield any improvement in quality under any circumstances that we
     have identified.

  5) Epson printers produce much better quality on plain paper than
     previously.

  6) All of the dithering algorithms, except for Hybrid
     Floyd-Steinberg (which is not recommended for most purposes) have
     been improved.  Ordered dithering is now on a par with Adaptive
     Hybrid dithering for most image types other than line art, and
     Fast and Very Fast are viable choices for test prints on even
     high quality printers.  The Adaptive Random and Random
     Floyd-Steinberg algorithms have been dropped, as they offer no
     advantage over the faster Adaptive Hybrid and Hybrid
     Floyd-Steinberg algorithms.

  7) PCL printers will print typical sparse text pages much more
     efficiently.

  8) The package as a whole will use significantly less memory,
     particularly when printing at high resolutions.


* Changes to the Gimp Print plugin:

  1) The plugin now provides tooltips for all controls (a
     much-requested feature!).

  2) The plugin now provides many new options for positioning the
     image on the page.  These options are described in the tooltip
     help for the preview window.

  3) The GUI has been considerably rearranged, and we hope it is more
     logical.

  4) Printing in black and white is now accomplished in the Output
     Type radio button group rather than the Image Type group.

  5) It is now possible to define a logical printer queue (essentially
     a group of settings saved under a name).

  6) The preview window is much more responsive than before.  The
     preview both moves more quickly and does not flash to as great a
     degree as before.

  7) The plugin will no longer allow settings that are inappropriate
     for the current printer or output mode.


* Changes to the CUPS Driver:

  1) The CUPS driver now offers color adjustment choices (currently in
     the form of choice menus).

  2) The CUPS driver now supports printing CMYK output, as well as
     RGB, grayscale, and black and white.

  3) The CUPS driver no longer allows attempts to print in color to
     black and white printers.

  4) The CUPS PPD files are now translated into several languages
     (currently British English, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Polish,
     and Danish).

  5) The CUPS driver will now terminate a job cleanly if the job is
     removed from the queue while it was printing.  The existing data
     will be flushed to the printer, following which the driver will
     cleanly terminate the print job.  Previously, the printer was
     left in an indeterminate state.

  6) The CUPS driver will build correctly on BSD-based systems.  This
     requires CUPS 1.1.11 or above.


* Changes to the Ghostscript Driver:

  1) A new, simplified build procedure is provided for use with
     Ghostscript 5.50 and 6.51.  This requires copying only one file
     into the Ghostscript source directory, and links dynamically
     against the driver library.  This permits upgrades to the 4.2
     driver library (e. g. to support new printers) without
     recompiling Ghostscript.  The old method is still available, but
     we recommend using the new procedure.

  2) Printing black and white only images is now accomplished with
     -dColor=2 rather than -dImageType=3.


* Miscellaneous changes:

  1) Escputil (a utility for managing Epson printers) is more robust
     than in 4.0, and uses the readline package where available for
     better interaction.

  2) Roll feed printing is supported for Epson printers with the
     capability, such as the Stylus Photo 870.

  3) The package supports custom page sizes for printers allowing
     this.  It also imposes minimum paper size limits for printers
     that require a minimum paper size.

  4) The Debian package build procedure is now compliant with
     Standards-Version 3.5.6.0 and is lintian-clean.  It will build on
     `woody' and later distributions.

  5) The compilation phase of the build emits more warnings than under
     4.0, particularly in the Gimp plugin.  These extra warnings are
     due to greater compiler checking of the code.


* Incompatibilities between 4.0 and 4.2:

  1) The options for the Ghostscript driver have changed incompatibly
     between 4.0 and 4.2.  Please read src/ghost/README for more
     information.

  2) The PPD files for the 4.2 CUPS driver are incompatible with the
     4.0 driver, and vice versa.  You must reinstall all of your print
     queues to use the new driver.

  3) The Foomatic data in the 4.2 distribution is generated during the
     build of the package, rather than being distributed statically.
     It requires the latest version of the Foomatic driver, and is
     incompatible with the Foomatic data in 4.0.  The 4.2 driver is
     named "Gimp-print" in Foomatic, as opposed to "stp" in 4.0.

  4) Printing pure black and white (not grayscale) images is
     different.  The exact procedure is described in the release notes
     for each front end.


* Known Limitations:

  1) The CUPS PPD files are not translated on all systems.  BSD
     systems in particular are known to fail to translate these files.
     This is discussed in detail in the README.

  2) The Epson Stylus C40UX (and very likely other printers in the C20
     and C40 lines) do not identify themselves.  Therefore,

     escputil -u -d

     will not return anything useful, and when performing print head
     alignment, the printer model must be specified, as autodetection
     will not work.

  3) The "align color" (-o) command to escputil does not currently
     work on the printers that should support it (Epson Stylus Color
     480 and 580, and C20SX, C20UX, C40SX, and C40UX).  We do not know
     if this is a bug in the software or a limitation of the printers.

  4) Changing ink cartridges on the Epson Stylus Color 480/580 is not
     supported.

  5) The drivers for the Epson Stylus Pro printers (5000, 5500, 7000,
     7500, 9000, 9500, and 10000) are only partially tested and tuned.
     They are known not to work correctly in many modes.

  6) The Epson Stylus Photo 2000P is not properly tuned and likely
     produces lower output quality than other Epson printers.

  7) The Canon BJC-8200 and S800 do not produce optimum quality.

  8) Many Epson printers (including the Stylus Photo 870/875, 1270,
     780/785/895, 890, 1280/1290, and 810/820) do not produce optimum
     quality on Premium Glossy Photo Paper.  In particular, color
     quality may not be at quite as high a standard as it is on the
     older Photo Paper.  The difference is subtle; for most purposes
     the output quality will be superb.  Tuning the color output may
     or may not improve the quality.

  9) The Postscript driver (ps and ps2) does not generate multi-page
     output correctly.  This should not be a major problem, as there
     is little reason to use it outside of the GIMP.  There are no
     plans at present to fix this bug.


* Internal changes:

  1) The interface between the core drivers and the front ends has
     been completely reimplemented.  There is now a core driver
     library (libgimpprint) with the front ends linking against it.
     The interface has been redesigned to some degree, allowing for
     better separation between driver and front-end concerns.

     The package takes full advantage of the autoconf machinery.

     Other front ends may be written against the driver; a test
     pattern generator is provided in src/testpattern that can be used
     to generate test patterns, or used as the basis for other
     applications.

     A gimpprint-config script, similar to gtk-config and gimp-config,
     is provided.

  2) The core driver package now operates in CMY space rather than RGB
     space.  The change has very little immediate effect, but it will
     enable significant improvements in future releases.

  3) Two new input modes (8 and 16 bit CMYK) are provided.  The 8-bit
     CMYK interface is gamma and density corrected; the 16 bit CMYK is
     a raw input, with no correction performed.  This is useful for
     applications desiring the greatest possible control over the
     output while taking advantage of the dithering and device driving
     capabilities of the package.

  4) The "unprint" program supplied in the test directory is much more
     functional and accurate than previously.


Supported Printers:

Many variations on these printers are also supported.  Generally, the
Epson printers are fully supported, although not fully tuned in all
cases; the Canon, HP, and Lexmark printers vary.  Printers listed as
NEW are newly introduced into Gimp-Print 4.2.2.

Please see the printer-specific notes section following the list of
printers for any instructions specific to your printer.

Printer-Specific Notes:

    * The Epson Stylus C70, C80, and C82 will give better results
      using Three Color Composite printing on Premium Glossy Photo
      Paper and Premium Semigloss.  Epson's proprietary drivers do
      this on these papers.  The black ink is formulated differently
      from the others, and does not adhere properly to these special
      papers.

    * The Epson Stylus C70, C80, and C82 appear to support resolutions
      of 1440x1440 and 2880x1440, but these resolutions may not yield
      any improvement over 2880x720.  Experiments suggest that
      1440x1440 yields slightly better results than 2880x720 on Epson
      Photo Paper, but somewhat inferior results on Premium Glossy
      Photo Paper.  2880x1440 yields essentially no additional
      improvement on Photo Paper, and intermediate results on Premium
      Glossy Photo Paper.

      We expect that 1440x1440 would yield maximum improvement over
      2880x720 on line art with very fine detail.  It is unlikely that
      2880x1440 would yield any significant additional improvement.

      Note that these resolutions are not officially supported by Epson,
      and may not work on all C70, C80, and C82 printers.

    * Many Epson printers (specifically, the Epson Stylus Color 740
      and all newer printers) will not respond to ASCII text without a
      special "activation" sequence (specifically, this command takes
      the printers out of "packet mode").  A brand new printer, or one
      that has been connected to a Windows system, may or may not work
      in packet mode.  Therefore, the common suggestion to test a
      printer port by sending plain text to it may not work for these
      printers; failure to print in this fashion is not a positive
      indication that the printer or the connection is malfunctioning.
      These printers are, however, able to print plain text *after*
      the activation sequence is sent.

      A suggestion would be to use the escputil command to print a
      test pattern:

      escputil -n -u -P printer

      or

      escputil -n -u -r /dev/lp0

      The `-u' option will send the activation sequence.  In addition
      to printing the test pattern (if at least unidirectional
      communication is set up), this will enable printing plain ASCII
      text, at least until the printer is powered off (or used under
      Windows).

      To test bidirectional communication, the command

      escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0

      is a good choice, as it will print (to the screen) the amount of
      ink in the printer.

      Note that this activation sequence is both unnecessary and
      incorrect on older printers.

      The current list of printers for which the activation sequence
      must be sent is:

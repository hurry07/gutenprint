Gimp-Print 4.2.0, released November 24, 2001, is the latest stable release
of this package.  This release offers numerous improvements over the
previous stable release, 4.0

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers, including Foomatic data.

The Gimp Print plugin requires the Gimp 1.2.

The CUPS driver requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher (1.1.12 or above is
highly recommended).

The Ghostscript driver requires Ghostscript 5.10, 5.50, 6.51, or any
later GNU Ghostscript release based on 6.51 (e. g. 6.52).

Please read the README file for full instructions on building and
installing this package.

Gimp-Print 4.2 contains the following major changes over Gimp-Print
4.0:


* Major Bugs Fixed from 4.0:

  1) A problem with fine black data printing incorrectly in 4.0 has
     been fixed.

  2) Very small images print correctly in the Gimp plugin.

  3) A number of minor bugs in scaling and positioning in the Gimp
     plugin are fixed.

  4) Printing pure black and white (monochrome) to black and white
     printers now works properly, rather than silently being converted
     to grayscale.

  5) The package prints correctly in grayscale when the source
     resolution is higher than the output resolution.


* General User-Visible Changes:

  1) Many additional printers are supported, including several Lexmark
     printers for the first time.  The list of supported printers is
     at the bottom of this release memo.

  2) Default printing resolutions are 300x300 or 360x360 DPI for all
     printers, rather than the lowest available resolution.  On Epson
     printers, the default 360x360 printing modes are in most cases
     higher quality than the default 360x360 mode in 4.0.

  3) The same defaults for all driver and printer characteristics
     apply to all front ends (the Gimp plugin, the CUPS driver, and
     the Ghostscript driver).

  4) A user's manual (for the CUPS driver and GIMP plugin) is now
     supplied with the package.

  5) A developer's manual is now supplied with the package.  This
     describes how to use the library interface, how to tune printers,
     and other topics.

  6) The package is now internationalized.  Full translations are
     available for Swedish and British English; partial translations
     are currently available for French, Norwegian, Danish, and
     Polish.


* Quality Improvements:

  1) Color accuracy in Photograph and Solid Colors mode is greatly
     improved over 4.0.  This is most noticeable on red, green, blue,
     and violet colors.  Generally, prints should need little if any
     tuning.

  2) Printed images are much smoother (more even) in texture.  This is
     particularly true on 6-color (photo) and variable drop size
     printers.  The transition between light and dark inks in 6-color
     printers should be invisible to the unaided eye at all but the
     lowest resolutions.

  3) In color mode, fine black detail prints much more accurately than
     previously.  Previously, fine black detail typically did not
     print solidly; this was particularly noticeable when printing
     groups of lines at high resolution.

  4) Epson printers support a greater range of resolutions and quality
     settings, from very low resolution draft mode up to 2880x1440 for
     the newest Epson printers.  This offers a full range of
     speed/quality tradeoffs for any printing application.  The
     emulated resolutions in 4.0 have been dropped, as they do not
     yield any improvement in quality under any circumstances that we
     have identified.

  5) Epson printers produce much better quality on plain paper than
     previously.

  6) All of the dithering algorithms, except for Hybrid
     Floyd-Steinberg (which is not recommended for most purposes) have
     been improved.  Ordered dithering is now on a par with Adaptive
     Hybrid dithering for most image types other than line art, and
     Fast and Very Fast are viable choices for test prints on even
     high quality printers.  The Adaptive Random and Random
     Floyd-Steinberg algorithms have been dropped, as they offer no
     advantage over the faster Adaptive Hybrid and Hybrid
     Floyd-Steinberg algorithms.

  7) PCL printers will print typical sparse text pages much more
     efficiently.

  8) The package as a whole will use significantly less memory,
     particularly when printing at high resolutions.


* Changes to the Gimp Print plugin:

  1) The plugin now provides tooltips for all controls (a
     much-requested feature!).

  2) The plugin now provides many new options for positioning the
     image on the page.  These options are described in the tooltip
     help for the preview window.

  3) The GUI has been considerably rearranged, and we hope it is more
     logical.

  4) Printing in black and white is now accomplished in the Output
     Type radio button group rather than the Image Type group.

  5) It is now possible to define a logical printer queue (essentially
     a group of settings saved under a name).

  6) The preview window is much more responsive than before.  The
     preview both moves more quickly and does not flash to as great a
     degree as before.

  7) The plugin will no longer allow settings that are inappropriate
     for the current printer or output mode.


* Changes to the CUPS Driver:

  1) The CUPS driver now offers color adjustment choices (currently in
     the form of choice menus).

  2) The CUPS driver now supports printing CMYK output, as well as
     RGB, grayscale, and black and white.

  3) The CUPS driver no longer allows attempts to print in color to
     black and white printers.

  4) The CUPS PPD files are now translated into several languages
     (currently British English, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Polish,
     and Danish).

  5) The CUPS driver will now terminate a job cleanly if the job is
     removed from the queue while it was printing.  The existing data
     will be flushed to the printer, following which the driver will
     cleanly terminate the print job.  Previously, the printer was
     left in an indeterminate state.

  6) The CUPS driver will build correctly on BSD-based systems.  This
     requires CUPS 1.1.11 or above.


* Changes to the Ghostscript Driver:

  1) A new, simplified build procedure is provided for use with
     Ghostscript 5.50 and 6.51.  This requires copying only one file
     into the Ghostscript source directory, and links dynamically
     against the driver library.  This permits upgrades to the 4.2
     driver library (e. g. to support new printers) without
     recompiling Ghostscript.  The old method is still available, but
     we recommend using the new procedure.

  2) Printing black and white only images is now accomplished with
     -dColor=2 rather than -dImageType=3.


* Miscellaneous changes:

  1) Escputil (a utility for managing Epson printers) is more robust
     than in 4.0, and uses the readline package where available for
     better interaction.

  2) Roll feed printing is supported for Epson printers with the
     capability, such as the Stylus Photo 870.

  3) The package supports custom page sizes for printers allowing
     this.  It also imposes minimum paper size limits for printers
     that require a minimum paper size.

  4) The Debian package build procedure is now compliant with
     Standards-Version 3.5.6.0 and is lintian-clean.  It will build on
     `woody' and later distributions.

  5) The compilation phase of the build emits more warnings than under
     4.0, particularly in the Gimp plugin.  These extra warnings are
     due to greater compiler checking of the code.


* Incompatibilities between 4.0 and 4.2:

  1) The options for the Ghostscript driver have changed incompatibly
     between 4.0 and 4.2.  Please read src/ghost/README for more
     information.

  2) The PPD files for the 4.2 CUPS driver are incompatible with the
     4.0 driver, and vice versa.  You must reinstall all of your print
     queues to use the new driver.

  3) The Foomatic data in the 4.2 distribution is generated during the
     build of the package, rather than being distributed statically.
     It requires the latest version of the Foomatic driver, and is
     incompatible with the Foomatic data in 4.0.  The 4.2 driver is
     named "Gimp-print" in Foomatic, as opposed to "stp" in 4.0.

  4) Printing pure black and white (not grayscale) images is
     different.  The exact procedure is described in the release notes
     for each front end.


* Known Limitations:

  1) The CUPS PPD files are not translated on all systems.  BSD
     systems in particular are known to fail to translate these files.
     This is discussed in detail in the README.

  2) The Epson Stylus C40UX (and very likely other printers in the C20
     and C40 lines) do not identify themselves.  Therefore,

     escputil -u -d

     will not return anything useful, and when performing print head
     alignment, the printer model must be specified, as autodetection
     will not work.

  3) The "align color" (-o) command to escputil does not currently
     work on the printers that should support it (Epson Stylus Color
     480 and 580, and C20SX, C20UX, C40SX, and C40UX).  We do not know
     if this is a bug in the software or a limitation of the printers.

  4) Changing ink cartridges on the Epson Stylus Color 480/580 is not
     supported.

  5) The drivers for the Epson Stylus Pro printers (5000, 5500, 7000,
     7500, 9000, 9500, and 10000) are only partially tested and tuned.
     They are known not to work correctly in many modes.

  6) The Epson Stylus Photo 2000P is not properly tuned and likely
     produces lower output quality than other Epson printers.

  7) The Canon BJC-8200 and S800 do not produce optimum quality.

  8) Many Epson printers (including the Stylus Photo 870/875, 1270,
     780/785/895, 890, 1280/1290, and 810/820) do not produce optimum
     quality on Premium Glossy Photo Paper.  In particular, color
     quality may not be at quite as high a standard as it is on the
     older Photo Paper.  The difference is subtle; for most purposes
     the output quality will be superb.  Tuning the color output may
     or may not improve the quality.

  9) The Postscript driver (ps and ps2) does not generate multi-page
     output correctly.  This should not be a major problem, as there
     is little reason to use it outside of the GIMP.  There are no
     plans at present to fix this bug.


* Internal changes:

  1) The interface between the core drivers and the front ends has
     been completely reimplemented.  There is now a core driver
     library (libgimpprint) with the front ends linking against it.
     The interface has been redesigned to some degree, allowing for
     better separation between driver and front-end concerns.

     The package takes full advantage of the autoconf machinery.

     Other front ends may be written against the driver; a test
     pattern generator is provided in src/testpattern that can be used
     to generate test patterns, or used as the basis for other
     applications.

     A gimpprint-config script, similar to gtk-config and gimp-config,
     is provided.

  2) The core driver package now operates in CMY space rather than RGB
     space.  The change has very little immediate effect, but it will
     enable significant improvements in future releases.

  3) Two new input modes (8 and 16 bit CMYK) are provided.  The 8-bit
     CMYK interface is gamma and density corrected; the 16 bit CMYK is
     a raw input, with no correction performed.  This is useful for
     applications desiring the greatest possible control over the
     output while taking advantage of the dithering and device driving
     capabilities of the package.

  4) The "unprint" program supplied in the test directory is much more
     functional and accurate than previously.


Supported Printers:

Many variations on these printers are also supported.  Generally, the
Epson printers are fully supported, although not fully tuned in all
cases; the Canon, HP, and Lexmark printers vary.  Many printers
previously supported have greatly improved support.

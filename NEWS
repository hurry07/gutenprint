This is gimp-print version 4.1.3, a development release on the 4.1 line.

This software includes the Print plug-in for the Gimp, and GhostScript
and CUPS drivers.  The support for printers in GhostScript and CUPS is
identical to the support for these printers in the Print plugin --
they use the identical code base.  Please read Ghost/README and
CUPS/README.txt for more information on this.

The Gimp Print plugin requires the Gimp 1.2.

Print 4.1.3 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.2:

1) The source has been completely reorganized.  Please read the README
   file for more information!

2) Improvements to the Lexmark driver.


Print 4.1.2 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.1:

1) We believe this release contains an important bug fix that in some
   cases caused the Epson driver to seg fault upon completion.  This
   resulted in the page being slightly incomplete at the bottom, and
   in addition the page was not ejected.

2) Further improvements in quality (we believe) in Photograph mode.

3) Correct sizing for extremely tiny images in the Print plugin.

4) First cut at roll feed printing for the Epson Stylus Photo
   870/1270.

5) Support for custom paper sizes in the Print plugin.

6) Initial support for the Lexmark 3200, and other improvements in the
   Lexmark driver.

7) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus Photo 790/890/1290
   (followons to the 870/1270).

8) Fixes to the Debian installation.

9) Preliminary support for the Canon BJC-55 and BJC-85.

10) The Ghostscript Makefile snippets now contain a proper dependency
   on gdevstp-print.h.

11) Many internal changes to prepare for a major code reorganization
   that is coming up shortly.  These changes should be completely
   invisible at user level.


Print 4.1.1 contains the following fixes and improvements over 4.1.0:

1) Further improvements in quality (we believe) in Photograph mode.

2) A problem whereby black letters and other black detail had a hollow
   appearance under some circumstances is fixed.

3) The Canon S450 is now supported.

4) The Epson Stylus Color 640 and 660 should print correctly.

5) escputil now uses readline when available.


Print 4.1.0 contains all fixes through the 4.0.4 release.  In
addition, it contains the following user-visible differences over
Print 4.0.4:

1) Greatly improved color quality in Photograph mode.  In particular,
   red, green, blue, and violet colors are much more accurate.  This
   is done by means of hue and luminosity adjustments based on input
   hue and saturation.  This only works in Photograph mode; Line Art
   and Solid Colors have not changed.

2) Preliminary support for the Lexmark Z52 inkjet printer.

3) Support for 2880x720 on Epson Stylus printers that support that
   resolution.  The visible quality difference will probably be little
   if any.

4) Fine black detail in color mode is greatly improved.

5) Many new resolutions have been added for Epson Stylus printers,
   mostly supporting better print quality at 180, 360, and 720 DPI.

6) There is preliminary support for 600x600 C-RET mode on the HP 840.

7) The foomatic package is not currently being distributed with
   gimp-print.  The main issue is synchronizing the foomatic database
   with the rapidly evolving state of gimp-print.  We have not
   determined yet whether it will be practical to continue
   distributing foomatic with gimp-print.

8) The PPD's generated as part of the native CUPS driver are
   incompatible with the PPD's in the 4.0 version of the native CUPS
   driver.  This requires reinstalling your printers after running
   'make install' in the cups subdirectory.

9) The defaults with the native CUPS driver are now identical to the
   defaults with the Ghostscript stp driver and the Gimp Print
   plugin.

10) Ordered dithering is now smoother on 6 color printers, at some
   loss of color fidelity.

 * Test for the soft weave algorithm.  This program calculates the weave
 * parameters for each input line and verifies that a number of conditions
 * are met.  Currently, the conditions checked are:
 *
 * 1) Pass # is >= 0
 * 2) The nozzle is within the physical bounds of the printer
 * 3) The computed starting row of the pass is not greater than the row
 *    index itself.
 * 4) The computed end of the pass is not less than the row index itself.
 * 5) If this row is the last row of a pass, that the last pass completed
 *    was one less than the current pass that we're just completing.
 * 6) For a given pass, the computed starting row of the pass is the same
 *    for all rows comprising the pass.
 * 7) For a given pass, the computed last row of the pass is the same
 *    for all rows comprising the pass.
 * 8) The input row is the same as the row computed by the algorithm.
 * 9) If there are phantom rows within the pass (unused jets before the
 *    first jet that is actually printing anything), then the number of
 *    phantom rows is not less than zero nor greater than or equal to the
 *    number of physical jets in the printer.
 * 10) The physical starting row of the pass (disregarding any phantom
 *    rows) is at least zero.
 * 11) If there are phantom rows, the number of phantom rows is less than
 *    the current nozzle number.
 * 12) If we are using multiple subpasses for each row, that each row within
 *    this pass is part of the same logical subpass.  Thus, if the pass in
 *    question is the first subpass for a given row, that it is the first
 *    subpass for ALL rows comprising the pass.  This doesn't matter if we're
 *    simply overlaying data; it's important if we have to shift the print head
 *    slightly between each pass to accomplish high-resolution printing.
 * 13) We are not overprinting a specified (row, subpass) pair.
 *
 * In addition to these per-row checks, we calculate the following global
 * correctness checks:
 *
 * 1) No pass starts (logically) at a later row than an earlier pass.

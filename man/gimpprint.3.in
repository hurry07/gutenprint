.SH NAME
\fBgimpprint\fR - High quality bitmap printing library

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <gimp-print/gimp-print.h>\fR
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgimpprint\fR library routines give programmers an interface to print
high quality bitmap images on most modern printers.  It includes drivers which
provide printing quality for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary
vendor-supplied drivers in many cases, and can be used for many of the most
demanding printing tasks.

.SH NAME
escputil - maintain Epson Stylus inkjet printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B escputil [\-P printer | \-r device] [\-m model] [\-u]
[\-c | \-n | \-a | \-i | \-d | \-o | \-s | \-l | \-M | \-h] [\-q]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIescputil\fP is a command line utility to perform various
maintenance tasks on Epson Stylus inkjet printers.  These tasks
include head alignment, head cleaning, nozzle check, printer
identification, and retrieval of ink level from the printer.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIescputil\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-printer-name \fI<printer>\fP
Specify the name of the printer to operate on.
Default is the default system printer.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-raw-device \fI<device>\fP
Specify the name of the device to write to directly
rather than going through a printer queue. You must use this (rather
than specifying a printer) when retrieving ink levels or identifying
the printer, or if you wish to perform head alignment without
specifying the printer model.
.TP
.B \-m <model>, \-\-model <model>
Specify the precise printer model for head alignment.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-new
The printer is a new printer (Stylus Color 740 or newer).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clean-head
Clean the print head.  This can also be performed from the printer
front panel.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nozzle-check
Print a nozzle test pattern.  Dirty or clogged nozzles will show as
gaps in the pattern.  If you see any gaps, you should run a
head cleaning pass or two.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-align-head
Align the print head.  CAUTION: Misuse of this option may result in
poor print quality and/or damage to the printer.  You must either
specify the printer model with the \-m option, or use the raw printer
device to allow escputil to detect the printer model.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ink-level
Obtain the ink level from the printer.  This requires
read/write access to the raw printer device.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-identify
Query the printer for make and model information.
This requires read/write access to the raw printer
device.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-align\-color
Align the color print head (used by Stylus Color 480 and 580 only).  CAUTION:
Misuse of this option may result in poor print quality and/or damage to the
printer.   
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-status
Retrieve printer status.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-license
Display the license/warranty terms of this program.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-list\-models
List the supported printer models.
.TP
.B  \-h, \-\-help
Display a list of all command line options.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress the banner.

.SH BUGS
.PP
USB-connected printers sometimes fail to identify or return ink
levels.  You may have to repeat the command.  This is probably a
timing issue in escputil, not a flaw in the printer.
.PP
Anything requiring bidirectional communication with the printer (identify, ink
levels, or head alignment without specifying the printer model) requires
read/write access to the printer port (for example /dev/lp0).  This may require
these operations to be performed as root.  In addition, kernel support is
required for bidirectional communication.  For Linux version 2.2,
\fICONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK\fP should be enabled; this is called
\fICONFIG_PARPORT_1284\fP on 2.4 and later kernels.
.PP
If the printer is performing self-test or head cleaning on power
up, the identify and ink level commands will time out, although the
printer successfully receives the command.  The command will need to
be reissued when the printer is quiescent.

Package: gimp-1.1-print
Architecture: any
Depends: [/usr/lib/gimp/1.1/plug-ins/*]
Description: Updated "print" plugin for the GIMP 1.1
 This package includes an updated print plugin for version 1.1 of
 the GIMP.  It will divert your current print plugin out of the way,
 and restore it when this package is removed.
 .
 This print plugin features numerous improvements over the plugin included
 with the Gimp, including:
 .
  - Support for many more printers.
 .
  - Far better print quality, including better dithering
    algorithms and more control over colour.
 .
  - Revamped user interface.
 .
  - Driver settings can be saved between invocations.
 .
 This driver is also available as a Ghostscript driver.

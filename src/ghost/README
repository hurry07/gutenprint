PROGRAM:
--------

 Gimp-Print 4.1 includes an associated Ghostscript driver, which is
 named `stp'.  That name originally referred to Epson Stylus Photo
 printers; this is the first Ghostscript driver which supported those
 printers with high quality.  The same driver now supports many Canon,
 HP, and Lexmark printers.

 This driver works with GhostScript 5.10, 5.50, and 6.51.  Due to
 incompatibilities between the Aladdin Free Public License (AFPL) and
 the GNU General Public License (GPL), this driver may not be combined
 and distributed with versions of GhostScript not covered by the GPL.
 We will not fix bugs reported against combinations of this driver
 with AFPL-only versions of GhostScript.


AUTHOR:
-------

 This Ghostscript frontend was originally written by Henryk Richter
 (buggs@comlab.uni-rostock.de); it since has been fully integrated
 into gimp-print.  Gimp-Print itself was originally written by Michael
 Sweet <mike@easysw.com>, who released up to version 2.0; Robert
 Krawitz released version 3.0.  The gimp-print development team
 (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) now maintains the entire package.

BUILD AND INSTALLATION:
----- --- -------------

1) Get a recent Ghostscript (5.10, 5.50, or 5.61) and prepare the
   sources as described in the documentation (don`t forget zlib,
   libpng and libjpeg when downloading the source) for compiling

2) If you are using Ghostscript 5.50 or 6.51, you have two choices.
   The recommended (newer) method follows.  This method builds the stp
   driver by linking against the libgimpprint library that is
   installed on your system.  If you wish to use the older method (or
   you're using Ghostscript 5.10), which actually installs all of the
   Gimp-Print source files into your Ghostscript source tree, please
   skip to step 7.


3) The recommended (newer) method requires you to build and install
   Gimp-print, and links against the installed libgimpprint.so or
   libgimpprint.a.

   Run "./configure" in the top level directory (../.. from here),
   "make", and "make install".  You may also need to run "ldconfig" as
   root following "make install".

   You may optionally run

   ./configure --without-gimp

   if you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin.  Note that you
   do *not* need to run "./configure --with-ghost" as before.

4) Copy the file "gdevstp.c" from this directory into the Ghostscript
   source directory.  Depending upon the version of Ghostscript you
   use, this may be either the top level of your Ghostscript source
   distribution, or the "src/" subdirectory.

5) Edit the file "contrib.mak" (in either the top level or src/
   subdirectory, depending upon your version of Ghostscript) by adding
   the contents of "contrib.mak.addon", which should have been created
   by running configure.  Be careful to add *exactly* the contents of
   this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that the tab
   characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into spaces, and as
   a result when you run 'make' it will fail.

   If you reinstall Gimp-Print in a new location (by using configure
   --prefix, configure --exec-prefix, or configure --includedir), you
   must edit the contrib.mak file appropriate.  The contrib.mak.addon
   file in this directory is automatically updated by running
   configure.

6) Skip to step 9.


7) If you are using Ghostscript 5.10, or prefer to use the old, tried
   and true method for building the driver, copy all "*.c" and "*.h"
   files to the Ghostscript source directory.  Depending upon the
   version of Ghostscript you use, this may be either the top level of
   your Ghostscript source distribution, or the "src/" subdirectory.

8) If you are using Ghostscript 5.50 or 6.51: edit the file
   "contrib.mak" (in either the top level or src/ subdirectoy,
   depending upon your version of Ghostscript) by adding the contents
   of "contrib.mak.addon.old".  Be careful to add *exactly* the
   contents of this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that
   the tab characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into
   spaces, and as a result when you run 'make' it will fail.

8) If you are using Ghostscript 5.10: edit the file "devs.mak" (in
   either the top level or src/ subdirectoy, depending upon your
   version of Ghostscript) by adding the contents of
   "devs.mak.addon-5.10".  Be careful to add *exactly* the contents of
   this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that the tab
   characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into spaces, and as
   a result when you run 'make' it will fail.


10) Add "$(DD)stp.dev" to the line "DEVICE_DEVS6=..." in the makefile
   used by Ghostscript (this is usually accessible as "makefile" in
   the top level Ghostscript source, but that is normally just a
   symbolic link to a system-specific makefile, such as unix-gcc.mak).
   If there are multiple lines that start with DEVICE_DEVS6=, you may
   add this to any such line.  If there is no DEVICE_DEVS6= line, you
   may add it to any other DEVICE_DEVSx line that is present.

11) Compile and install gs as described in the Ghostscript
   documentation.  After a successful compiler run you got a new
   driver named "stp". Check this by calling "gs -h" with the newly
   compiled Ghostscript.

The distribution includes a utility named "escputil" that performs
many utility functions, such as head cleaning, nozzle alignment, and
the like.  This is normally compiled by "make" and installed by "make
install".


DEBIAN:
-------

Debian users can try the following (contributed by Stuart Miles and
updated by Dan Christensen <jdc@julian.uwo.ca>): versions are current
as of 5 October 2000.  The Debian installation procedure is being
extensively redone as of February 2001.

Download the debianised sources for gs-aladdin and libjpeg to the
directory containing the print-x.xxx directory:

# apt-get source gs libjpeg62

(Make sure you have a deb-src entry in /etc/apt/sources.list first!
See the sources.list(5) man page for more info on setting up apt.)

The name of the libjpeg package may vary.

This will download the .dsc, orig.tar.gz and diff.gz files, unpack and
patch the files for you.

Rename the libjpegxxx (currently libjpeg6b-6b) directory to libjpeg.

To compile gs you will also need the following installed:

# apt-get install sharutils zlib1g-dev svgalibg1-dev libpng2-dev vflib2-dev

The name of the packages may vary. The above corresponds to

sharutils 4.2.1-2 shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode
zlib1g-dev 1.1.3-11 compression library - development
svgalibg1-dev 1.4.1-2 Shared, non-x, graphics library used by Ghos
libpng2-dev 1.0.8-1 PNG library - development
vflib2-dev 2.25.1-5 Vector Font Library for Japanese Character C

but current versions (and possibly older versions) will probably
work as well.

Next do the following:

# mkdir gs-x.xx/contrib/stp
# cd print-x.xxx/Ghost
# cp gdevstp* *.mak.addon* ../../gs-x.xx/contrib/stp
# cp README ../../gs-x.xx/contrib/stp/README.stp
# cp debian-patch ../../gs-x.xx/debian
# cp debian-patch-stp ../../gs-x.xx/debian/patches/stp
# cd ../../gs-x.xx/debian
# patch < debian-patch [patches control and rules files]
# chmod u+x addentry [maybe this should be fixed in the tar file?]
# cd .. [now we are in gs-x.xx]
# debian/rules binary

The rules script will copy the sourcefiles and README.stp into the
main gs directory, patch contrib.mak, add the stp entry to
unix-gcc.mak, compile gs, package it all up as a .deb package
(gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb) and put the resulting file in the directory
above gs.

To install it:

# cd ..
# dpkg -i gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb

If you have gs or gs-aladdin installed, it will be removed.

DISCLAIMER:

This is not an official Debian package. This method works for at
least one person. To be really neat and tidy other files need
modifying to ensure that this custom package gets marked as such and
_not_ an official package. The only problem I've found is that I
the gs-pdfencrypt insists on having gs installed rather than gs-stp.
If you know how to fix this, please update this README.


OPTIONS:
--------

 Options for the stp driver are given in normal Ghostscript
 manner. The resolution of the image calculated by Ghostscript is not
 bound to the resolution of the printer output. It is for example
 possible to specify "-r360" to gs and print the output in 1440x720
 dpi (see below for driver parameter). The result is a somewhat faster
 operation of the driver.

 The driver will not permit use of invalid settings.

Most or all of the Epson Stylus printers are fully functional.  The
others vary.  In particular, all of the listed Epson Stylus Photo
printers print in full 6-color photo mode; most of the others do not.
The color output has also been better tuned for Epson Stylus printers
than for others.


Print Resolution Selection:
----- ---------- ----------

-sQuality=quality

The meaning of this is model-specific.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sQuality, and the second (long) name is descriptive.

For Epson Stylus printers, within each specified resolution, the
quality is generally listed from worst to best (and generally higher
quality means lower speed).  For example, 360 DPI Unidirectional is
better than 360 DPI.  Characteristics of specific models and
individual printers may affect the orderings to some degree; on many
printers, unidirectional printing will improve quality substantially
more than using an otherwise better quality printing mode.

"Softweave", "High Quality", and "Highest Quality" use algorithms
within the driver to generate the sequence of rows printed.  On
printers capable of supporting variable dot sizes, only these printing
modes can generate the smallest dots (3, 4, or 6 picolitres, or pl)
that the printer is capable of.  In addition, the algorithms we use
produce very high quality results, with very little banding.  We
strongly suggest use of these modes where available.

The difference between "Softweave", "High Quality", and "Highest
Quality" lies in the number of passes made over each line.  The
"Softweave" modes always perform the fewest passes required for any
given resolution; High and Highest quality perform more.  This trades
off printing speed against quality.

"Microweave" modes, and modes with no specified quality other than
unidirectional, use algorithms within the printer to generate the
sequence of rows printed.  These algorithms generally only work well
at low printing resolutions.  Many printers do not support this kind
of printing at resolutions of 720 DPI and above, and some printers
that do actually print just one row (using just one nozzle per color)
at a time.  While this particular use will produce extremely high
quality (no banding whatsoever, normally), it may eventually damage
the print head due to ink pooling.  All printers that we are aware of
have no such trouble at 360 DPI.

Generally, we recommend use of 360 DPI printing modes for most
purposes on plain paper (perhaps 720x360 for the best quality output).
Use of 720 DPI and above simply takes more time to compute and print
the page, with little quality gain.  For draft purposes, use of 180 or
360x120 DPI will not produce solidly black output, but will save ink
and time.  On high quality "photo" papers, we recommend use of 720 DPI
for proofing and 1440x720 DPI for final output.  720x360 may be
acceptable for initial proofs, but on may printers it will not
generate sufficient density.  360 DPI will produce very coarse output
that may lack sufficient density on these high quality papers.

We believe that generally there is little reason to use 2880x720 DPI.
The actual resolution this produces will not be much better than
1440x720 DPI, but it will take twice as long to generate the output.
The exception is on the Stylus Color 980: this printer produces
sufficiently small dots (3 pl) that they can take advantage of such
high resolution.  Even in that case, 1440x720 will likely produce more
than adequate output.

The following resolutions are supported on printers other than the
Stylus Pro (5000, 5500, 7000, 7500, 9000, 9500, and 10000) printers.
Resolutions for those printers are listed in a later section.

     180 DPI works for draft mode on printers with dot spacing of 1/90
     or 1/180 inch.  This includes the Stylus Color, Stylus Color 440,
     460, 600, 640, 660, 670, 800, 850, 900, 980, 980, 1500, 1520,
     3000, and Stylus Photo, Stylus Photo 700, 720 and EX.

180dpi          '180 DPI'
180uni          '180 DPI Unidirectional'

     360x120 DPI works for draft mode on printers with dot spacing of
     1/120 inch.  This includes the Stylus C20 and C40, the Stylus
     Color Pro, 400, 480, 500, 580, 680, 740, 760, 777, 860, 880, 83,
     and 1160, and the Stylus Photo 750, 780, 790, 870, 890, 1270,
     1280, 1290, and 2000P.

Color Balancing Values: (min,max,default)
----- --------- ------- -----------------

All of the values below are interpreted as being relative to norms for
a particular printer established through testing, not "absolute"
values of any kind.

-dCyan=xxx       xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-dMagenta=xxx    xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-dYellow=xxx     xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 These three options allow specification of the cyan, magenta, and
 yellow levels independently, for rebalancing the levels.  Normally,
 these should be adjusted to yield neutral gray, but they can be used
 for other effects.

-dBrightness=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brightness of the image.  0.0 gives a fully black image;
 2.0 gives a fully white image.  Values greater than 1 will result in
 black not being solid and highlights turning white; values less than
 1 will result in white not being perfectly clear and shadows turning
 black.

-dContrast=xxx   xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the contrast of the image.  0.0 gives a solid gray for the
 entire image, the exact gray depending upon the brightness chosen.

-dGamma=xxx      xxx: 0.1 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the gamma of the image, over and above the printer-specific
 correction.  Gamma less than 1.0 will result in a darker image; gamma
 greater than 1.0 will result in a lighter image.  Unlike brightness,
 gamma adjustment does not change the endpoints; it merely changes the
 shape of the input->output curve.

-dDensity=xxx    xxx: 0.1 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the amount of ink deposited on the paper.  If you've chosen
 the correct paper type and you're getting ink bleeding through the
 paper or puddling, try reducing the density to the lowest value you
 can while still achieving solid black.  If you're not getting solid
 black, even with the contrast and brightness at 1.0, try increasing
 the density.

 All of the printers supported here actually need less than 100% ink
 density in most cases, so the actual density is something other than
 the nominal density setting.  The effective density setting cannot go
 above 100%, so if a value specified will result in an excessively
 high density level, it will be silently limited to 1.0.

-dSaturation=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 9.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brilliance of colors.  0.0 results in pure grayscale;
 using this with -dColor=1 is one way of getting grayscale (see below
 under -dColor for a full discussion).  Saturation of less than 1.0
 results in more muted colors; saturation of greater than 1.0 results
 in more vibrant colors.  Very high saturation often results in very
 strange effects, including posterization and banding that might not
 be expected.  For normal purposes, the saturation should generally be
 less than 1.5.


Dithering Algorithms:
--------- -----------

The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sDither, and the second (long) name is descriptive.

-sDither=algorithm

Adaptive        'Adaptive Hybrid'
Ordered         'Ordered'
Fast            'Fast'
VeryFast        'Very Fast'
Floyd           'Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg'

We recommend using Adaptive Hybrid (which is the default) with text or
other fine black detail, or if this is mixed with continuous tone
images, and Ordered for pure continuous-tone images and photographs
(no text).  Ordered is somewhat faster than Adaptive Hybrid, and
normally yields almost identical results.  However, Ordered dithering
may show small breaks in very fine lines, which may lead to
undesirable moire patterns and other artifacts; Adaptive Hybrid is
more resistant to this effect.

Error diffusion algorithms (Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg is such an
algorithm) perform very well at high densities, and are capable of
rendering very fine detail well, but they tend to exhibit artifacts in
the form of "waves" or "worms" of dots which results in noticeable
texturing in pale areas.  Furthermore, pale areas immediately adjacent
to white take a while to "build up" sufficient error to print at all.
This is sometimes called "tearing".

The Fast algorithm gives the fastest results at the expense of color
accuracy.  It is a simplified ordered dither.  On simple four color
printers (or other printers used in four color mode), the quality is
similar to Ordered, although dark gray rendition is not as good due to
a simpler transfer between black and colored ink.  With six-color
printers, color rendition is somewhat worse, but it should be quite
usable in cases where optimum quality is not critical.  In black and
white, it is an efficient way to render grayscale, but it may not give
best results when used with variable dot size printers.  On rare three
color printers (CMY only) the results should be identical to ordered
dither.

Very Fast is even faster than Fast, with even more loss of quality.
It uses a power of 2 matrix that can be looked up more quickly and
performs certain other optimizations.  On laser printers, and possibly
on certain kinds of text and line art, Very Fast dithering may
actually yield the best quality.


Ink Types
--- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.
The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sInkType, and the second (long) name is descriptive.  Not all ink
types are supported on all printers.

-sInkType=inktype


For Epson printers:

Six color printers can print using four color inks or all six colors.
Six color mode is recommended for photographs.  Four color mode may be
useful when printing text with embedded graphics to reduce ink
consumption, or to print higher quality with Ordered, Fast, or Very
Fast dithering (see below).

The "Composite" modes use only color inks (no black) to produce all
colors and black.  These ink types are rarely useful, but on certain
types of paper they may produce a smoother image than that produced by
mixing black ink in.  The Epson Stylus Color 1500 cannot mix black ink
with colored inks; on this printer, Three Color Composite must be
used.

As of this writing (September 2001), no seven color printers are sold
in North America.  When such a printer is sold, the Seven Color
Enhanced and Six Color Enhanced Composite modes will utilize all of
these inks.

Photo7          'Seven Color Enhanced'
PhotoEnhance    'Six Color Enhanced Composite'
PhotoCMYK       'Six Color Photo'
PhotoCMY        'Five Color Photo Composite'
CMYK            'Four Color Standard'
RGB             'Three Color Composite'


For Canon, Lexmark (other than 4076), and Compaq printers:

Gray            'Black'
RGB             'Color'
CMYK            'Black/Color'
PhotoCMY        'Photo/Color'
PhotoCMYK       'Photo'


For PCL (Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark 4076) printers:

CMYK            'Color + Black Cartridges'
Photo           'Color + Photo Cartridges' (For Deskjet 69x only)


Media Types
----- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.
Two names are listed for each resolution; the first (short) name is
the value that must be passed to -sMediaType, and the second (long) name
is descriptive.

This is printer-specific.  The option names are case-sensitive.  Two
names are listed for each resolution; the first (short) name is the
value that must be passed to -sPaperSize, and the second (long) name is
descriptive.  This option does not set GhostScript up to use a paper
size other than the default; it only tells the driver to set up the
printer for a different paper size.  The default paper size is
'Letter'.

Output Type
------ ----

-dColor=x          x:   0 ...   2  (1 on color printers, 0 otherwise)

0  Grayscale
1  Color
2  Black and white

 Choose color vs. grayscale output.  Color output is the default.
 Choosing -dColor=0 results in only black ink (no color ink) being
 used, which is faster and usually results in the most accurate
 grayscale, but at the expense of smoothness.  If you want composite
 color (using a mixture of color and black inks to produce gray), use
 -dColor=1 and -dSaturation=0.0 (see -dSaturation above).

 In addition, using -dColor=0 uses luminance (perceived brightness) of
 red, green, and blue to choose output levels.  Blue of a given
 intensity is perceived to be much darker than red, which in turn
 appears darker than green.  -dColor=1 and -dSaturation=0.0 does not
 use luminance.

 -dColor=2 prints only black and white (thresholding).  This option is
 extremely fast (particularly when combined with Very Fast dithering)
 for printing pure black and white line art or text.


Image type (to optimize the dither):
----- ---- --- -------- --- --------

-dImageType=x x:   0 ...   2  (0)
Select the image type most representative of what's being printed.

0  Line art (color or gray scale)
1  Primarily solid colors or smooth gradients (color or gray scale)
2  Continuous-tone photographs (color or gray scale)

Option 2 provides greatly improved color quality.  Option 0 will
dither faster and yield sharper text, but at some possible cost to
color accuracy and/or smoothness.  Option 1 may yield smoother images
and/or more accurate color.  Option 2 will yield the best natural
images, but is quite slow.

Note that any of the modes may be used with either color or black &
white output.  If black and white output is requested, but a color
mode used, composite color will be printed.  This generally offers
smoother tone, but less purity of gray or black, than pure black ink.
Furthermore, it is possible to tune the color of the gray (to achieve
warmer or cooler effects) using the color controls in this fashion.


EXAMPLES:
---------

Example 1 (print charts to file, color, 360 dpi):
gs -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-ex -dDensity=1.6 -dGamma=1.5 -dSaturation=0.9 \
   -dBrightness=.4 -dImageType=1 -sOutputFile=itsyourchoice.prn foo.ps

Example 2 (print color photograph to /dev/lp0 at maximum quality):
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-870 -dDensity=0.8 \
   -r1440x720 -sQuality=1440x720hq -dImageType=2 -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 foo.ps

Example 3 (print pure black text to stdout)
gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=stp -sModel=escp2-660 -dDensity=0.8 -r720 \
   -sQuality=720sw -dOutputType=2 -sOutputFile=- foo.ps


SPOOLER CONFIGURATION
------- -------------

The options to this driver are very complex.  The Foomatic package
makes configuration simpler.

CUPS users may also use the CUPS driver.  This is a more
traditional CUPS driver written by Mike Sweet that may be more
familiar to CUPS users.

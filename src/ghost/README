INTRODUCTION:
-------------

 Gimp-Print 4.2 includes an associated Ghostscript driver, which is
 named `stp'.  That name originally referred to Epson Stylus Photo
 printers; this is the first Ghostscript driver which supported those
 printers with high quality.  The same driver now supports many Canon,
 HP, and Lexmark printers.

 This driver works with GhostScript 5.10, 5.50, and 6.51.  It should
 work with any later releases on the 6.5x GNU Ghostscript line, such
 as 6.52XS.  Due to incompatibilities between the Aladdin Free Public
 License (AFPL) and the GNU General Public License (GPL), this driver
 may not be combined and distributed with versions of GhostScript not
 covered by the GPL.  We will not fix bugs reported against
 combinations of this driver with AFPL-only versions of GhostScript.


AUTHOR:
-------

 This Ghostscript frontend was originally written by Henryk Richter
 (buggs@comlab.uni-rostock.de); it since has been fully integrated
 into gimp-print.  Gimp-Print itself was originally written by Michael
 Sweet <mike@easysw.com>, who released up to version 2.0; Robert
 Krawitz released version 3.0.  The gimp-print development team
 (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) now maintains the entire package.

BUILD AND INSTALLATION:
----- --- -------------

1) Get a recent Ghostscript (5.10, 5.50, or 6.51 or its successors)
   and prepare the sources as described in the documentation (don`t
   forget zlib, libpng and libjpeg when downloading the source) for
   compiling

2) If you are using Ghostscript 5.50 or 6.51, you have two choices.
   The recommended (newer) method follows.  This method builds the stp
   driver by linking against the libgimpprint library that is
   installed on your system.  If you wish to use the older method (or
   you're using Ghostscript 5.10), which actually installs all of the
   Gimp-Print source files into your Ghostscript source tree, please
   skip to step 7.  We strongly recommend that all Ghostscript users,
   except for those who cannot upgrade from 5.10, use the new method.


3) The recommended (newer) method requires you to build and install
   Gimp-print, and links against the installed libgimpprint.so or
   libgimpprint.a.  Run

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   in the top level directory (../.. from here).

   "make install" typically needs to be run as root.  You may also
   need to run "ldconfig" as root following "make install".

   You may optionally run

   ./configure --without-gimp

   if you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin.  Note that you
   do *not* need to run "./configure --with-ghost" as before.

4) Copy the file "gdevstp.c" from this directory into the Ghostscript
   source directory.  Depending upon the version of Ghostscript you
   use, this may be either the top level of your Ghostscript source
   distribution, or the "src/" subdirectory.

5) Edit the file "contrib.mak" (in either the top level or src/
   subdirectory, depending upon your version of Ghostscript) by adding
   the contents of "contrib.mak.addon", which should have been created
   by running configure.  Be careful to add *exactly* the contents of
   this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that the tab
   characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into spaces, and as
   a result when you run 'make' it will fail.

   If you reinstall Gimp-Print in a new location (by using configure
   --prefix, configure --exec-prefix, or configure --includedir), you
   must edit the contrib.mak file appropriately.  The contrib.mak.addon
   file in this directory is automatically updated by running configure.

6) Skip to step 11.


7) If you are using Ghostscript 5.10, or prefer to use the old, tried
   and true method for building the driver, run

   ./configure --with-ghost
   make

   in the top level directory (../.. from here).

   You may optionally run

   ./configure --without-gimp --with-ghost

   if you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin.

8) Copy all "*.c" and "*.h" files from this directory to the
   Ghostscript source directory.  Depending upon the version of
   Ghostscript you use, this may be either the top level of your
   Ghostscript source distribution, or the "src/" subdirectory.

9) If you are using Ghostscript 5.50 or 6.51: edit the file
   "contrib.mak" (in either the top level or src/ subdirectoy,
   depending upon your version of Ghostscript) by adding the contents
   of "contrib.mak.addon.old".  Be careful to add *exactly* the
   contents of this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that
   the tab characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into
   spaces, and as a result when you run 'make' it will fail.

10) If you are using Ghostscript 5.10: edit the file "devs.mak" (in
   either the top level or src/ subdirectoy, depending upon your
   version of Ghostscript) by adding the contents of
   "devs.mak.addon-5.10".  Be careful to add *exactly* the contents of
   this file; if you cut and paste it, you may find that the tab
   characters in contrib.mak.addon get transformed into spaces, and as
   a result when you run 'make' it will fail.


11) Add "$(DD)stp.dev" to the line "DEVICE_DEVS6=..." in the makefile
   used by Ghostscript (this is usually accessible as "makefile" in
   the top level Ghostscript source, but that is normally just a
   symbolic link to a system-specific makefile, such as unix-gcc.mak).
   If there are multiple lines that start with DEVICE_DEVS6=, you may
   add this to any such line.  If there is no DEVICE_DEVS6= line, you
   may add it to any other DEVICE_DEVSx line that is present.

12) Compile and install gs as described in the Ghostscript
   documentation.  After a successful compiler run you get a new
   driver named "stp".  Check this by calling "gs -h" with the newly
   compiled Ghostscript.

The distribution includes a utility named "escputil" that performs
many utility functions, such as head cleaning, nozzle alignment, and
the like, for Epson Stylus printers.  This is normally compiled by
"make" and installed by "make install".


DEBIAN:
-------

Debian users can try the following (contributed by Stuart Miles and
updated by Dan Christensen <jdc@julian.uwo.ca>): versions are current
as of 5 October 2000.  The Debian installation procedure is being
extensively redone as of February 2001.

As of version 5.50 and 6.61, the current Debian packages in testing
(woody) and unstable (sid) are linked with libgimpprint, thus
saving you the effort of doing any patching yourself!  Because it
uses a shared object (libgimpprint.so), you may upgrade the
gimp-print drivers simply by installing a newer version of the
libgimpprint library.

NOTE: the script 'scripts/make-deb.sh' does the following for you.
      It is probably better to upgrade to a new 5.50 or 6.51 release;
      only use this if you are running stable (potato) or earlier.

Download the debianised sources for gs-aladdin and libjpeg to the
directory containing the print-x.xxx directory:

# apt-get source gs libjpeg62

(Make sure you have a deb-src entry in /etc/apt/sources.list first!
See the sources.list(5) man page for more info on setting up apt.)

The name of the libjpeg package may vary.

This will download the .dsc, orig.tar.gz and diff.gz files, unpack and
patch the files for you.

Rename the libjpegxxx (currently libjpeg6b-6b) directory to libjpeg.

To compile gs you will also need the following installed:

# apt-get install sharutils zlib1g-dev svgalibg1-dev libpng2-dev vflib2-dev

The name of the packages may vary. The above corresponds to

sharutils 4.2.1-2 shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode
zlib1g-dev 1.1.3-11 compression library - development
svgalibg1-dev 1.4.1-2 Shared, non-x, graphics library used by Ghos
libpng2-dev 1.0.8-1 PNG library - development
vflib2-dev 2.25.1-5 Vector Font Library for Japanese Character C

but current versions (and possibly older versions) will probably
work as well.

Next do the following:

# mkdir gs-x.xx/contrib/stp
# cd print-x.xxx/Ghost
# cp gdevstp* *.mak.addon* ../../gs-x.xx/contrib/stp
# cp README ../../gs-x.xx/contrib/stp/README.stp
# cp debian-patch ../../gs-x.xx/debian
# cp debian-patch-stp ../../gs-x.xx/debian/patches/stp
# cd ../../gs-x.xx/debian
# patch < debian-patch [patches control and rules files]
# chmod u+x addentry [maybe this should be fixed in the tar file?]
# cd .. [now we are in gs-x.xx]
# debian/rules binary

The rules script will copy the sourcefiles and README.stp into the
main gs directory, patch contrib.mak, add the stp entry to
unix-gcc.mak, compile gs, package it all up as a .deb package
(gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb) and put the resulting file in the directory
above gs.

To install it:

# cd ..
# dpkg -i gs-stp_5.10-9.1_i386.deb

If you have gs or gs-aladdin installed, it will be removed.

DISCLAIMER:

This is not an official Debian package. This method works for at
least one person. To be really neat and tidy other files need
modifying to ensure that this custom package gets marked as such and
_not_ an official package. The only problem I've found is that I
the gs-pdfencrypt insists on having gs installed rather than gs-stp.
If you know how to fix this, please update this README.


OPTIONS:
--------

Overview:
---------

Options for the stp driver are given in normal Ghostscript
manner. The resolution of the image calculated by Ghostscript is not
bound to the resolution of the printer output. It is for example
possible to specify "-r360" to gs and print the output in 1440x720
dpi (see below for driver parameter). The result is a somewhat faster
operation of the driver.

The driver will not permit use of invalid settings.

The options for this driver are very complex.  We strongly recommend
use of a printer management system such as Foomatic rather than
configuring a spooler manually with this driver.

Most or all of the Epson Stylus printers are fully functional.  The
others vary.  In particular, all of the listed Epson Stylus Photo
printers print in full 6-color photo mode; most of the others do not.
The color output has also been better tuned for Epson Stylus printers
than for others.


Print Resolution Selection:
----- ---------- ----------

-sQuality=quality

The meaning of this is model-specific.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sQuality, and the second (long) name is descriptive.  Each printer
has its own default value; for most printers, this is a reasonable 300
or 360 DPI resolution.


For Epson Stylus printers:

Within each specified resolution, the quality is generally listed from
worst to best (and generally higher quality means lower speed).  For
example, 360 DPI Unidirectional is usually better than 360 DPI.
Characteristics of specific models and individual printers may affect
the orderings to some degree; on many printers, with certain papers,
unidirectional printing will improve quality substantially more than
using an otherwise better quality printing mode.

The difference between different quality settings lies in the number
of passes made over each line.  "High" and "Highest" quality settings
perform more passes, printing fewer dots with each pass over the same
line and using different nozzles for each pass.  This reduces banding
effects, but requires more time.

"Microweave" modes use algorithms within the printer to generate the
sequence of rows printed.  These algorithms generally only work well
at low printing resolutions.  Many printers do not support this kind
of printing at resolutions of 720 DPI and above, and some printers
that do actually print just one row (using just one nozzle per color)
at a time.  While this particular use will produce extremely high
quality (no banding whatsoever, normally), it is extremely slow and
may eventually damage the print head due to ink pooling.  All printers
that we are aware of have no such trouble at 360 DPI.

We generally recommend the following resolutions for the following
purposes:

360x90    Fast economy draft output on plain paper (output will be very
360x120   banded and not very dark).

180       Economy draft output on plain paper (output will not be very
	  dark).

360x180   Draft output on plain paper (output will not be solidly
360x240   black); economy draft output on good quality inkjet paper.

360       Standard quality output on plain paper (output will be
	  solidly black); draft output on good quality inkjet paper.

720x360   High quality output on plain paper; standard output on good
	  quality inkjet paper.

720       Maximum quality on plain paper; high quality on good inkjet
	  paper; proofs on photo-quality paper.  On many printers,
	  there will be little difference between this and 720x360 on
	  plain paper.

1440x720  High quality on photo paper; use 1440x720 Highest Quality to
          reduce microbanding if needed.  While this will work on plain
          paper, it usually offers little improvement over 720 DPI.

2880x720  Highest quality on photo paper.  While this may yield
          slightly improved quality, it will generally not be markedly
          superior to 1440x720 Highest Quality, except on the Stylus
          Color 980 and Stylus C70 and C80, where it may yield a
          noticeable improvement.  It takes as long to print as
          1440x720 highest quality, but twice as long to generate the
          output.

1440x1440 An unsupported mode that offers higher quality than 2880x720
          for certain types of images on very high quality paper.  It
          does not appear to offer any advantage on smooth tones, but
          fine detail (particularly vertical, and to a lesser extent
          near-horizontal) it shows noticeable improvement.  It takes
          as long to print as 2880x720.  1440x1440 highest quality
          takes twice as long to print.

2880x1440 An unsupported mode that may offer higher quality than
          2880x720 for certain types of images on very high quality
          paper.  Experiments conducted thus far demonstrate little if
          any improvement over 1440x1440.  It takes twice as long to
          print as 2880x720 or 1440x1440, and as long to print as
          1440x1440 highest quality.

Ink Types
--- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.
The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sInkType, and the second (long) name is descriptive.  Not all ink
types are supported on all printers.

-sInkType=inktype


For Epson and Lexmark (other than the 4076) printers:

Six color printers can print using four color inks or all six colors.
Six color mode is recommended for photographs.  Four color mode may be
useful when printing text with embedded graphics to reduce ink
consumption, or to print higher quality with Ordered, Fast, or Very
Fast dithering (see below).

The "Composite" modes use only color inks (no black) to produce all
colors and black.  These ink types are rarely useful, but on certain
types of paper they may produce a smoother image than that produced by
mixing black ink in.  The Epson Stylus Color 1500 cannot mix black ink
with colored inks; on this printer, Three Color Composite must be
used.

As of this writing (September 2001), no seven color printers are sold
in North America.  When such a printer is sold, the Seven Color
Enhanced and Six Color Enhanced Composite modes will utilize all of
these inks.

Photo7          Seven Color Enhanced

Black and white PCL printers (laser printers, in particular) do not
allow any value to be specified for the ink type.


Media Types

the value that must be passed to -sMediaType, and the second (long) name
is descriptive.

We have found that glossy photo papers not specifically designed for
Epson printers generally perform poorly in Epson printers.  The ink
tends to pool on the paper, causing muddy shadows and possibly leaving
ink on the printer rollers.  Use of the highest quality printing modes
(1440x720 highest quality and 2880x720 unidirectional) produces the
best result on such papers, probably because printing is slower and
there is more time for the ink to dry.

This is printer-specific; we cannot list the correct values for each
printer here.  The option names are case-sensitive.  Two names are
listed for each resolution; the first (short) name is the value that
must be passed to -sPaperSize, and the second (long) name is
descriptive.  This option does not set GhostScript up to use a paper
size other than the default; it only tells the driver to set up the
printer for a different paper size.  The default paper size is
'Letter'.

Color Balancing Values: (min,max,default)
----- --------- ------- -----------------

All of the values below are interpreted as being relative to norms for
a particular printer established through testing, not "absolute"
values of any kind.

-dCyan=xxx       xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-dMagenta=xxx    xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-dYellow=xxx     xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 These three options allow specification of the cyan, magenta, and
 yellow levels independently, for rebalancing the levels.  Normally,
 these should be adjusted to yield neutral gray, but they can be used
 for other effects.

-dBrightness=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brightness of the image.  0.0 gives a fully black image;
 2.0 gives a fully white image.  Values greater than 1 will result in
 black not being solid and highlights turning white; values less than
 1 will result in white not being perfectly clear and shadows turning
 black.

-dContrast=xxx   xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the contrast of the image.  0.0 gives a solid gray for the
 entire image, the exact gray depending upon the brightness chosen.

-dGamma=xxx      xxx: 0.1 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the gamma of the image, over and above the printer-specific
 correction.  Gamma less than 1.0 will result in a darker image; gamma
 greater than 1.0 will result in a lighter image.  Unlike brightness,
 gamma adjustment does not change the endpoints; it merely changes the
 shape of the input->output curve.

-dDensity=xxx    xxx: 0.1 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the amount of ink deposited on the paper.  If you've chosen
 the correct paper type and you're getting ink bleeding through the
 paper or puddling, try reducing the density to the lowest value you
 can while still achieving solid black.  If you're not getting solid
 black, even with the contrast and brightness at 1.0, try increasing
 the density.

 All of the printers supported here actually need less than 100% ink
 density in most cases, so the actual density is something other than
 the nominal density setting.  The effective density setting cannot go
 above 100%, so if a value specified will result in an excessively
 high density level, it will be silently limited to 1.0.

-dSaturation=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 9.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brilliance of colors.  0.0 results in pure grayscale;
 using this with -dColor=1 is one way of getting grayscale (see below
 under -dColor for a full discussion).  Saturation of less than 1.0
 results in more muted colors; saturation of greater than 1.0 results
 in more vibrant colors.  Very high saturation often results in very
 strange effects, including posterization and banding that might not
 be expected.  For normal purposes, the saturation should generally be
 less than 1.5.


Dithering Algorithms:
--------- -----------

The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sDither, and the second (long) name is descriptive.

-sDither=algorithm

Adaptive        Adaptive Hybrid
Ordered         Ordered
Fast            Fast
VeryFast        Very Fast
Floyd           Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg

For highest quality, we recommend use of Adaptive Hybrid dithering.
For continuous tone images, Ordered works just as well and is somewhat
faster.  Ordered dithering yields noticeably inferior results with
text and intricate line art, particularly at high resolutions.

Fast dithering, which is a simplified version of ordered dither, is
significantly faster, but color accuracy is worse, particularly on six
color printers and printer using variable dot sizes.  On simple four
color printers, the quality is quite reasonable, although color
printing will show more speckling in dark tones than Ordered dither.
For single dot size printers, printing grayscale, this algorithm
yields almost identical results to Ordered with some performance
improvement.  On three color printers, the results should be very
similar to Ordered.

Very Fast is even faster than Fast, with even more loss of quality.
It shows even more speckling, and the output is heavily patterned.  On
laser printers, and possibly on certain kinds of text and line art,
Very Fast dithering may actually yield the best quality.

Error diffusion algorithms (Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg is such an
algorithm) perform very well at high densities, and are capable of
rendering very fine detail well, but they tend to exhibit artifacts in
the form of "waves" or "worms" of dots which results in noticeable
texturing in pale areas.  Furthermore, pale areas immediately adjacent
to white take a while to "build up" sufficient error to print at all.
This is sometimes called "tearing".  Its use is not recommended.


Output Type
------ ----

-dColor=x          x:   0 ...   2  (1 on color printers, 0 otherwise)

0  Grayscale
1  Color
2  Black and white

 Choose color vs. grayscale output.  Color output is the default.
 Choosing -dColor=0 results in only black ink (no color ink) being
 used, which is faster and usually results in the most accurate
 grayscale, but at the expense of smoothness.  If you want composite
 color (using a mixture of color and black inks to produce gray), use
 -dColor=1 and -dSaturation=0.0 (see -dSaturation above).

 In addition, using -dColor=0 uses luminance (perceived brightness) of
 red, green, and blue to choose output levels.  Blue of a given
 intensity is perceived to be much darker than red, which in turn
 appears darker than green.  -dColor=1 and -dSaturation=0.0 does not
 use luminance.

 -dColor=2 prints only black and white (thresholding).  This option
 always uses Fast dithering unless you specify Very Fast.


Image type (to optimize the dither):
----- ---- --- -------- --- --------

-dImageType=x x:   0 ...   2  (0)
Select the image type most representative of what's being printed.

0  Line art (color or gray scale)
1  Primarily solid colors or smooth gradients (color or gray scale)
2  Continuous-tone photographs (color or gray scale)

Option 0 is the fastest.  It generates strong, but not particularly
accurate, colors.  There may be some fairly sharp color transitions in
this mode.

Option 1 generates more accurate colors, but is slower.

Option 2 generates the most accurate colors, but is considerably
slower.

Note that any of the modes may be used with either color or black &
white output.  If black and white output is requested, but a color
mode used, composite color will be printed.  This generally offers
smoother tone, but less purity of gray or black, than pure black ink.
Furthermore, it is possible to tune the color of the gray (to achieve
warmer or cooler effects) using the color controls in this fashion.

Specifying a lower GhostScript resolution (with -r) results in faster
color conversion.  For example, if you print at 1440x720 DPI, but
specify a Ghostscript resolution of 360 DPI (with -r360), output will
be significantly faster and there will be much less difference in
performance between the three image type options.

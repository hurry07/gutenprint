  <en>STP supports a wide variety of Epson Stylus, HP DeskJet and LaserJet,
    and Canon BubbleJet printers, with the primary goal being
    uncompromising quality.  Epson Stylus printers in particular are
    supported in all resolutions and modes, and the latest printers are
    capable of producing prints that rival photographic prints in
    quality.  This package also offers much faster printing for high
    quality text and presentation graphics when required.

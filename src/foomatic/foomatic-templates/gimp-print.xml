    GIMP-Print supports a wide variety of Epson Stylus, HP DeskJet,
    LaserJet, Canon BubbleJet, Lexmark inkjet printers, with the
    primary goal being uncompromising quality.  Epson Stylus printers
    in particular are supported in all resolutions and modes, and the
    latest printers are capable of producing prints that rival
    photographic prints in quality. This package also offers much
    faster printing for high quality text and presentation graphics
    when required.&lt;p&gt;

    The execution information currently here corresponds to driver
    version @@STPVER@@. If you use another version, use the Foomatic
    data which comes with the GIMP-Print package.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that the Foomatic datafiles provided here are only for the
    GhostScript driver of GIMP-Print. For the native CUPS driver there
    are special PPD files provided by the GIMP-Print package.&lt;p&gt;

    To get a pre-patched/pre-compiled GNU-GhostScript 6.51 with this driver
    (version 4.2.0) download
    &lt;a href="http://space.tin.it/computer/wvtberti/linux/stp_driver/gs_stp.htm"&gt;Daniele Berti's source and binary RPMS&lt;/a&gt;.

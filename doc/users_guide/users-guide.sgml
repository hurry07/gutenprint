  <abstract>
  <para>
    The Gimp-Print Top Quality Printer Drivers (hereafter
called Gimp-Print) are a set of printer drivers written to
take advantage of the full capabilities of a wide range of
printers. These drivers should work on any POSIX compliant operating
system (e.g. Linux, Solaris, IRIX, etc).  This document will explain how to
use the Gimp-Print software to achieve high quality printouts from the
<ulink url="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</ulink> (GNU Image
Manipulation Program) and
<ulink url="http://www.cups.org">CUPS</ulink> (Common Unix Printing
System).
  </para>
  <para>
    Please note that in addition to using the Gimp-Print software as a
print plugin for the GIMP, and as a set of printer drivers for CUPS, this
software can also be compiled and used with the 
<ulink url="http://www.ghostscript.com">Ghostscript</ulink> software
and with the 
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html">Foomatic</ulink> 
software.
   </para>
   <para>
Regardless of whether the Gimp-Print software is used with the GIMP,
CUPS, Ghostscript, or Foomatic, the print quality and printer settings
remain the same.  However, use of the Gimp-Print with Ghostscript and
Foomatic is not covered in this document.  These topics may be covered
in a future revision of this document.
  </para>
  <para>
  This document corresponds to version 4.2.0 of the Gimp-Print
software. This document will serve as a guide to the user, and as such
will not explain how to install Gimp-Print, CUPS, GIMP, Ghostscript,
Foomatic, or any other related software.

  <chapter><title>Project History</title>
  <para>
This software package was first written by Michael Sweet of
<ulink url="http://www.easysw.com">Easy Software Products</ulink> and
initially worked only as a print plugin to the GIMP (GNU Image
Manipulation Program).  In the summer of 1999,
Robert Krawitz (the current
Gimp-Print project leader) purchased an Epson Stylus Photo EX printer
to feed his photography hobby. Finding no existing printer drivers, Robert
adapted Mike's Gimp-Print plugin to his six-color printer, and by the end
of the year released version 3.0 of the Gimp-Print software, which was
included in version 1.1 of the GIMP.  The intention was for this to be
the stable plugin in version 1.2 of the GIMP while development of the
Gimp-Print plugin continued for later release.
  </para>
  <para>
Robert put the Gimp-Print development tree on SourceForge starting
with version 3.1, and quickly found a group of like-minded people who wanted to print
high quality output on inexpensive inkjet printers. One of the main
goals, which was not expected to be met until late in the version 3.1
cycle, was to write a Ghostscript driver so that printing would not be
restricted to the GIMP.  Imagine Robert's surprise when Henryk "Buggs"
Richter wrote one within days!
  </para>
  <para>
In July 2000, not more than a year after Robert bought his Epson
Stylus Photo EX, he was invited to the Linux Printing
Summit hosted by VA Linux Systems. In preparation for that, he spent
long hours printing out test images.  Robert went back to the
Gimp-Print version 3.0.9 release, which seemed like such an advance
at the time,  and was floored at how far the project had come in four
months! Output that had been considered impressive with using six
colors was put to shame by four color output. That should give you
an idea what six color and variable dot size printers can do. It also
illustrates what a group of committed people can do.
  </para>
  <para>
Robert came away from the Printing Summit with a lot of new ideas, and in
November 2000, Gimp-Print version 4.0 was released, the culmination of 9 months
of work by the team.  The quality was already tremendously improved
over what the software could do at the Printing Summit.
  </para>
  <para>
The team started serious work on version 4.1 in December
2000, and version 4.2.0 was released in November 2001.  Despite the fact
that version 4.2.0 is a "minor" release over version 4.0, there are vast
improvements:

  </para>
  <para>
Releases of Gimp-Print have been historically numbered in
a fashion similar to that of the Linux kernel, where major releases
are denoted by the first digit (in this case '4'), while minor
releases are denoted by subsequent digits (such as '4.2.0').  Even
numbered minor releases are considered stable, while odd numbered
minor releases are considered development releases (whose stability
may vary for any given release).
  </para>
  <para>
This project is by no means finished.  In future releases, the development
team hopes to include the following:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>implementation of proper color management</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>improved dithering</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>improvements in performance</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
The entire Gimp-Print team hopes you will really enjoy using this
software!  For more information, please consult the GIMP-Print project

 <chapter id="ch-gimp-and-gimp-print"><title>GIMP and Gimp-Print</title>

  <sect1>
   <title>Running the GIMP</title>
  <para>
   This section assumes that you have the GIMP version 1.2 installed
and working properly on your computer, and that you have an image of
some type that you desire to print. To get started quickly, log into
your system, start the X window system, and bring up your favorite terminal
window.  At the $ prompt, type:

  <programlisting>
  <![ CDATA [
     $ gimp &
    ]]>
  </programlisting>

   This should start the GIMP for you. If it does not, check that
you have installed the GIMP properly, and that its binary is located
in one of the directories listed in your &dollar;PATH environment
variable. On the assumption that this worked, the screen should now
look something like this:

   <figure><title>The Startup Window for The GIMP</title>
   <mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
   <imagedata fileref="figures/gimp_startup.png" FORMAT="PNG">
   </imageobject>
   <textobject>
   <phrase>Startup window for The GIMP</phrase>
   </textobject>
   </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   </para>
   <para>
   At this point, you should use the

    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>

menu option to open your favorite picture. We will print this picture
shortly. Your picture should be displayed next to the GIMP startup
window, perhaps looking similar to the following (sssh! Don't tell
anybody the secret!):

   <figure><title>A Sample Image Displayed by The GIMP</title>
   <mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
   <imagedata scale="50" fileref="figures/gimp_image.png" FORMAT="PNG">

   </textobject>
   </mediaobject>
   </figure>

  </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>The Gimp-Print Graphical User Interface</title>
  <para>
   Now that the GIMP is displaying your picture, put your mouse over
the picture and click the right mouse button. A menu will appear.
Choose the
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Print</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
menu option. This will cause the Gimp-Print GUI window to appear (see
<xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-gui">). Move the mouse cursor
over the various parts of the Gimp-Print GUI window, and notice that
if you leave your mouse in one place for a short time without clicking
any buttons, a small box appears.  This box contains helpful text.
These small boxes are called "tooltips" and are intended to remind you
about the function of each part of the graphical interface.
    </para>
    <para>
The next several sections will continuously refer to
<xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-gui"> and
<xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-gui-1">.  The difference between
the two figures can be seen in the top right corner of the window.
Notice that there are two tabs, one which reads
<guilabel>Printer Settings</guilabel> and another which reads
<guilabel>Image/Output Settings</guilabel>.  Notice also that the
window is divided into several major sections which directly map to
the major sections of this document:

    <para>
      Click on the <guilabel>Printer Settings</guilabel> tab near the
top right hand corner of the window (see
<xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-gui">).  Then, click on the downward
facing arrow to the right of the <guilabel>Printer</guilabel> combo
box to see a list of the system printer queues.  Select the queue to which
you would like the printed image to be sent.  One may also print the
image directly to a file by selecting <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem>.
In this event, the user will be prompted for the filename when either the
<guibutton>Print</guibutton> button or the <guibutton>Print and Save
Settings</guibutton> button is clicked.
     </para>
     <para>
When either the <guibutton>Print and Save Settings</guibutton> button
or the <guibutton>Save Settings</guibutton> button is clicked,
the settings are saved in a file called
<filename>~/.gimp-1.2/printrc</filename>.  The user is cautioned about
hand editing this file since it is generated by Gimp-Print (although
it was the only way that the author found for removing bogus entries
created while playing with the <guibutton>New Printer</guibutton> button).
    </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>Setup Printer</title>
    <para>
     Before any useful printing can occur, the user needs to associate
the named printer with the
actual make and model of the printer.  Click the
<guibutton>Setup Printer</guibutton> button in
the <guilabel>Printer</guilabel> section of the window (the upper
right, and just below the Printer display box). When this is done, the
following window appears:

   <figure><title>The Setup Printer Window</title>
   <mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
   <imagedata scale="60" fileref="figures/gimp-print-setup.png" FORMAT="PNG">
   </imageobject>
   <textobject>
   <phrase>The Setup Printer Window</phrase>
   </textobject>
   </mediaobject>
   </figure>
    </para>

    <para>
     Scroll through the Printer Model section of the window until you
find a printer which matches yours. If you cannot find the precise
model, pick something close and hope for the best.  There are selections
for a wide array of Postscript, inkjet, and laser printers.  After you
have selected a printer, you will see the printer command displayed.
    </para>
    <para>
The Gimp-Print software does all of the necessary conversion of the
image to be printed into the language of your printer. It is
unnecessary and undesirable for any other sofware to manipulate this
data.  (This is why the command contains the "-l" switch or the "-o
raw" switch).  Please use care if you feel the need to edit this
command.  Once you are satisfied with your selection, click the
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> button.
    </para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>New Printer</title>

    <para>
     In the previous sections, the user selected an existing printer
queue and associated a particular type of printer to that queue.  For
most cases, this is probably all that is required.  However, some
situations might require more detailed control over the handling of
the printer data.
     </para>
     <para>
     Click the <guibutton>New Printer</guibutton> button to tell the
software that you wish to create a new name.  In this case, the new
name may actually be an existing printer with different settings that
you wish to save, or it may simply be a name associated with a
particular command for handling the printer data.  A window will
appear thus:

   <figure><title>The New Printer Window</title>
   <mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
   <imagedata fileref="figures/gimp-print-new-printer.png" FORMAT="PNG">
   </imageobject>
   <textobject>
   <phrase>The New Printer Window</phrase>
   </textobject>
   </mediaobject>
   </figure>

    Type a name into the window and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
(or <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> if you wish not to do this).
Notice that the new name now appears as the selected <guilabel>Printer</guilabel>.
As you change settings in the rest of the Gimp-Print GUI, they will be
associated with this printer name.  When the settings are saved,
they can be recovered easily by simply selecting this named printer
from the Printer combo box.
    </para>
    <para>
    One example where this feature might be used is as follows.  The
author frequently prints photos on Epson 4x6 photo paper.  Note that
this paper is physically larger than 4x6 and it has perforations on
all four sides.  The author dislikes printing part of the image on the
perforated parts of the paper which will be removed after
printing the photo.  By selecting the proper scaling percentage,
printing can be constrained to the 4x6 part of the paper which will
remain after the perforated sections are removed.  The author has
saved this setting using this feature of the Gimp-Print software.
    </para>

    </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Media Size</title>
   <para>
     The term <emphasis>media</emphasis> refers to paper, card stock,
envelopes, or whatever you have put into your printer onto which
something will be printed.  Click the arrow to the right of the
<guilabel>Media Size</guilabel> box to see a long list of different
sizes of media.  Choose the size that matches the media which you have
loaded into your printer.  Once you have made your choice, the drop
down menu will disappear, and your choice will be shown in the
<guilabel>Media Size</guilabel> box.  The available paper sizes will
vary depending upon the printer model you have selected.
   </para>
   <para>
   Some printers support arbitrary (within limits!) paper sizes.
   These printers will let you select <emphasis>Custom</emphasis>
   or <emphasis>Roll</emphasis> paper sizes.  When you select such a
   printer, one or both of the <guilabel>Dimensions</guilabel> boxes
   will let you enter your paper size (in inches or centimetres).  The
   boxes will not let you enter sizes that your printer cannot handle.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Media Type</title>
   <para>
     The type of media onto which your image will be printed should be
selected here.  Click on the arrow to the right of the <guilabel>Media
Type</guilabel> box to see a long list of the different types of media
onto which you may print your image.  Media types include such things
as plain paper, postcards, photo quality paper, transparencies, and
more!  Once you have made your choice, the drop down menu will
disappear, and your choice will be shown in the <guilabel>Media
Type</guilabel> box.  The choices available will vary depending upon
the printer model you have selected.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Media Source</title>
   <para>
     The <guilabel>Media Source</guilabel> box allows the user to
  choose the paper source, sometimes called <emphasis>Input
  Slot</emphasis>, that the paper will be fed from.  Many printers
  only have one available input source (such as the standard paper
  tray), in which case this entry will be grayed out.  If your printer
  does support multiple input sources, you may specify the source of
  your choice here.  Some Epson printers offer a roll feed option in
  addition to the standard paper tray, and many HP LaserJet printers
  have multiple paper trays.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Ink Type</title>
   <para>
   Some printers offer a choice of different types of ink or ink
   cartridges.  Many Canon and Lexmark printers support various
   combinations of cartridges, such as black only, black and color,
   photo color, and so forth.  Most Epson printers let you choose
   between three and four color printing (three color uses only color
   ink, while four color uses black ink as well).  Epson printers that
   support six color photo printing allow you to choose five and six
   color printing as well.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Resolution</title>
   <para>
     Click on the arrow to the right of the
<guilabel>Resolution</guilabel> box to see a long list of resolutions
at which you can print your image.  The list is written with the
lowest resolution at the top, with increasing resolution (and
generally improved printing quality) as you approach the bottom of the
list.  Different printers support different resolution options, and
many printers support different quality choices using the same basic
resolution.  In this menu are a few terms which may be unfamiliar to
you, and they will now be explained.
   </para>
     <sect4><title>DPI</title>
       <para>
         DPI is an acronym which stands for <emphasis>D</emphasis>ots
<emphasis>P</emphasis>er <emphasis>I</emphasis>nch.  This term refers
to the number of dots that your printer will print in a space of one
inch (approximately 2.54 cm).  This is highly dependent upon the
capability of your printer.  Resolutions below 300 DPI are
used for draft quality.  For general purpose printing, select
300 - 360 DPI.  Higher quality printing can be achieved by
selecting 600 - 720 DPI.  Settings higher than this are used for the
highest possible quality for printing photographs and other high
quality graphics.  Experiment with your printer and these settings
with different types of graphics and photographs to see what
results you can obtain with your printer.  High resolutions (large
numbers of dots per inch) require substantial image processing time,
and the print files can be very large; it's not uncommon for a full
page, 1440x720 DPI image to require 100 MB of temporary storage!
       </para>
     </sect4>
     <sect4><title>Draft or Fast Economy Draft</title>
     <para>
     When this text appears next to the resolution, it refers to the
fact that the quality will be relatively low, but suitable for rough
drafts.  Draft quality is higher than fast economy draft.  These
options will give you the fastest printing speed.  Economy Draft uses
less ink, and as a result the image will be pale.  These modes are
generally not very useful for printing photographs.
     </para>
     </sect4>

     <sect4><title>Unidirectional</title>
       <para>
         When printing an image, you have probably noticed the print
head inside the printer moving back and forth across the print media.
Many printers are capable of putting ink on the page regardless of
which direction the print head is moving.  However, quality can
sometimes be improved by only putting ink on the page when the printer
head is moving in one direction.  The
<guimenuitem>Unidirectional</guimenuitem> setting instructs the
software to only place ink on the page when the print head is moving
one way.  When the print head returns, it will not place ink on the
page.  On many printers, the print quality is better, at the expense
of printing speed.
       </para>
     </sect4>
     <sect4><title>High(est) Quality</title>
       <para>
         With lower quality print modes, one may see an effect where
the printed image looks like it has rows of stripes with a small
separation between the stripes.  This effect is called "banding" and
is undesirable.  In the <emphasis>high</emphasis> and
<emphasis>highest</emphasis> quality modes, the printer will make more
passes over the same part of the page in order to improve quality and
(reduce or) eliminate banding.  This requires more temporary disk
space and prints more slowly, but does not require significantly more
processing time.
       </para>
     </sect4>
     <sect4><title>Microweave</title>
       <para>
       Certain Epson printers (older models mostly) support a printing
       mode called <emphasis>Microweave</emphasis>.  This mode uses
       special software within the printer to improve the print quality.
       Microweave print modes will usually produce better quality
       output than non-Microweave modes, with only a small performance
       penalty.  If Microweave is not listed at your chosen
       resolution, fear not.  In those cases, the non-Microweave print
       modes offer similar printing quality improvements.
       </para>
     </sect4>
     <sect4><title>DMT</title>
       <para>
       DMT is an acronym which stands for <emphasis>D</emphasis>ot
       <emphasis>M</emphasis>odulation
       <emphasis>T</emphasis>echnology.
       This term refers to a print mode used by certain Canon printers
       to improve the quality of the printed output.  Unfortunately,
       at this time,  all of the available DMT modes do not work
       correctly.  The cases which do work correctly will offer
       significantly improved printing quality. 
       </para>
     </sect4>
   </sect3>
   </sect2>

  <sect2><title id="sec-preview">Preview</title>
  <para>
   Notice in the upper left of the window is a preview of your image.
This preview is a representation of where your picture will print on
the selected media, and approximately what it will look like.  This
preview will be updated as you modify selections in the
<guilabel>Position</guilabel>, <guilabel>Size</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Media Size</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Output Type</guilabel>
portions of the window. You may also select the image with your mouse
and move it manually if you wish. In doing so, you will note that the
<guilabel>Position</guilabel> settings are updated accordingly.  Take
note of the arrow, which points toward the top of the media, where top
is the first part of the media to enter the printer.
  </para>
  <para>
  The preview may be moved around the page as follows:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para> Clicking and dragging the <emphasis>left</emphasis>
  (primary) mouse button moves the image around the page as you would
  expect; the image moves with the mouse.  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para> Clicking and dragging the
  <emphasis>middle</emphasis> mouse button moves the image around the
  page in a finer fashion, such that each pixel of mouse movement
  moves the image by one point (1/72 inch).  This allows very fine

  <listitem><para> Clicking and dragging the

  <sect2><title id="sec-position">Position</title>

   <sect3><title>Orientation</title>
   <para>
      The Orientation menu allows the user to choose the orientation
of the paper.  The menu selections are
<guimenuitem>Auto</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Portrait</guimenuitem>,
<guimenuitem>Landscape</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Upside
down</guimenuitem>, and <guimenuitem>Seascape</guimenuitem>.  Click on
the rectangular tab to see these choices
and make your selection.  When you have done so, the pulldown menu
will have disappeared, and your choice will appear.  Also, note that
the preview image will have changed accordingly.
   </para>
   <para>
     When set to <guimenuitem>Auto</guimenuitem>, the software will make an
intelligent choice of orientation based on the dimensions of the image
to be printed.   <guimenuitem>Portrait</guimenuitem> orients the print media
with the longest edge going from top to bottom, while
<guimenuitem>Landscape</guimenuitem> orients the paper with the longest edge
going from side to side.  <guimenuitem>Upside down</guimenuitem> and
<guimenuitem>Seascape</guimenuitem> orient the paper the same as
<guimenuitem>Portrait</guimenuitem> and  <guimenuitem>Landscape</guimenuitem>
respectively, with the difference being that the image is rotated 180 degrees.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Automatic Centering</title>
   <para>
      There are three buttons that deal with centering an image.  The
leftmost button is the <guibutton>Vertically</guibutton> button, the
middle button is the <guibutton>Both</guibutton> button, and
the rightmost button is the <guibutton>Horizontally</guibutton>
button.  Use the <guibutton>Both</guibutton> button to center your
image both horizontally and vertically.  This will cause the top and
bottom borders to be equal, and the left and right borders to be
equal.  If you have placed your image manually by using the mouse
button, then you may center the image in the horizontal direction only
by clicking on the <guibutton>Horizontally</guibutton> button.
Likewise, to adjust the image only in the vertical direction, click on
the <guibutton>Vertically</guibutton> button.  Note that in
each case, the image is centered with regard to the edges of the
media, and without regard to the printable portion of the media.  Many
printers are incapable of printing to each edge of the media.  Some
media may have edges which detach.  Consult your printer documentation
for more details regarding your printer's capabilities in this regard.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Manual Settings</title>
   <para>
      You will notice that there are six boxes that contain numbers
just below the Orientation menu and just above the GUI buttons related
to centering an image.  When you move the preview image manually with
the mouse, or when you click on one of the centering buttons, the
preview image moves and these six boxes get updated.
   </para>
   <sect4><title>Left</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Left</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the left side of the image
will be printed away from the left edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>
   </sect4>
   <sect4><title>Right</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Right</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the right side of the image
will be printed away from the left edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>
   </sect4>
   <sect4><title>Right Border</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Right Border</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the right side of the image
will be printed away from the right edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>
   </sect4>
   <sect4><title>Top</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Top</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the top side of the image
will be printed away from the top edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>
   </sect4>
   <sect4><title>Bottom</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Bottom</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the bottom side of the image
will be printed away from the top edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>
   </sect4>

   <sect4><title>Bottom Border</title>
   <para>
     The number appearing in the <guimenuitem>Bottom Border</guimenuitem> box denotes
the number of units (cm or inches) that the bottom side of the image
will be printed away from the bottom edge of the media.  You may select
the units by clicking the <guibutton>Inch</guibutton> or
<guibutton>cm</guibutton> buttons in the  <guilabel>Units</guilabel> section just below
these GUI boxes.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2><title id="sec-scaling">Size</title>

   <sect3><title>Slider Bar and Spin Box</title>
   <para>
      The slider bar can be moved as desired by the user.  Notice
that while sliding this bar, the preview image changes accordingly.
One will also note that several boxes in the Gimp-Print GUI change values when this bar is moved.
These boxes are the six position boxes (left, right, right border,
top, bottom, bottom border), the two size boxes (width and height),
and the spin box to the right of the slider bar.
   </para>
   <para>
   This slider bar is used to scale the image to a desirable size, but the same effect can
be obtained by either clicking an arrow on the spin box to the right of this
slider bar, or by manually typing a number into this spin box.  Notice
that by setting the spin box in this way, the slider bar is also
moved.  All of the described methods will cause the image to be
scaled accordingly.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Scale by Percent or PPI</title>
   <para>
       One may choose to scale the image by a percentage, or by PPI,
which means "<emphasis>p</emphasis>ixels <emphasis>p</emphasis>er
<emphasis>i</emphasis>nch".  Click the radio button
next to the word to set the desired scaling factor.
   </para>
   <para>
     When scaling by a percentage, the number reflected in the spin
box next to the slider bar represents the percentage relative
to the full size of the selected print medium.  For example, with this spin box
set to 50, the image will be scaled to 50% of the size of the print
medium.  When set to 100, the image will attempt to fill the print
medium, within the constraints of maintaining the proper aspect ratio
and the margins of the selected print medium.  This effect can be seen
in the preview window.
   </para>
   <para>
     When scaling by PPI, the number reflected in the spin box next to
the slider bar represents the number of pixels that will be
printed per inch.  For example, if the user is printing a 640x480
image at a size of 6.4x4.8 inches (as measured by the size boxes), the
image will be printed at 100 DPI.
   </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Use Original Image Size</title>
     <para>
       By clicking this button, the image will be scaled to as close
to the native size of the image as possible.  This effect can
immediately be seen in the preview image.
     </para>
     <para>
     The native image size may be found or set in the GIMP by
     selecting <guimenuitem>Image/Scale Image</guimenuitem> in the
     GIMP.  Under the <guilabel>Print Size and Display Unit</guilabel>
     group in the <guilabel>Scale Image</guilabel> dialog, you can
     determine (or change) the width and height of the image, or
     choose the resolution.
     </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Width and Height</title>
     <para>
       These boxes show the size of the printed image in either inches
or centimeters (depending on which unit is selected).  The user may
choose to manually modify these values.  When one value is modified,
the other value is automatically modified in order to maintain the
aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height).  This effect can be
immediately seen in the preview image.
     </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Units</title>
   <para>
      The units can be set to inches or centimeters by clicking the appropriate
radio button next to the desired unit.  This setting effects the
values printed in the six position boxes (left, right, right border,
top, bottom, bottom border) and the two size boxes (width and height).
   </para>
   </sect3>

  </sect2>

  <sect2><title id="sec-image-settings">Image/Output Settings</title>
   <para>
   By clicking on the tab labeled <guilabel>Image/Output
Settings</guilabel>, the Gimp-Print window will appear as shown in
<xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-gui-1">.  Notice that there are
two sections to this portion of the window, namely,
<guilabel>Image Type</guilabel> and
<guilabel>Output Type</guilabel>.

   </para>

   <sect3><title>Image Type</title>

    <sect4><title>Line Art</title>
    <para>
      This setting tells the printer driver to generate color
quickly.  The color is bold and bright, but color accuracy is not very
good.  There may also be some unexpectedly sharp transitions in
colors.  This mode is acceptable for printing text with small amounts
of color, and may be acceptable for presentation graphics.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Solid Colors</title>
    <para>
      This mode produces color which is considerably more accurate
than the <guilabel>Line Art</guilabel> mode, but with a reduction in performance.  In
general, hues will be accurate but tonalities may not be accurate.
There should be no sharp transitions in colors.  This mode is good for
printing presentation graphics in most cases.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Photograph</title>
    <para>
      This mode produces the most accurate colors and tonalities at a
greater cost in performance.  This is the mode to use when printing
high quality photographs or other high quality images.
    </para>
    </sect4>

   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Output Type</title>
    <para>
      The user is given the choice of color, black and white, and
grayscale.  Color is selected when the desired output is to be in
color.  Greyscale will result in the printed image having various
shades of grey.  Black and white is just that.  The effect of this
setting can be seen in the preview window.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Adjust Output</title>
    <para>
      Clicking on this button causes the <guilabel>Print Color Adjust</guilabel> window to
appear (see <xref linkend="fig-gimp-print-color-adjust">).  In
this window, one will see a representation of the image to be printed
as well as several slider bars.  These slider bars collectively adjust
many different aspects of the image.  The values can also be adjusted
by clicking the arrows or by typing a value into the appropriate spin
box on the right side of each slider bar.

   </figure>

    <sect4><title>Brightness</title>
    <para>
    Adjust the brightness of the image.  A setting of 0.0 gives a fully black
image, while a 2.0 setting gives a fully white image.  Values greater than 1.0 will result in
 black not being solid and highlights turning white; values less than
 1.0 will result in white not being perfectly clear and shadows turning
 black.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Contrast</title>
    <para>
    Adjust the contrast of the image.  A setting of 0.0 gives a solid gray for the
entire image, the exact gray depending upon the brightness chosen.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Cyan, Magenta, Yellow</title>
    <para>
These three options allow specification of the cyan, magenta, and
yellow levels independently, for rebalancing the levels.  Normally,
these should be adjusted to yield neutral gray, but they can be used
for other effects.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Saturation</title>
    <para>
Adjust the brilliance of colors.  A setting of 0.0 results in pure grayscale.
A saturation setting of less than 1.0 results in more muted colors.  A
saturation setting of greater than 1.0 results in more vibrant colors.  Very high
saturation often results in very strange effects, including
posterization and banding that might not be expected.  For normal
purposes, the saturation should generally be set to a value less than 1.5.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Density</title>
    <para>
Adjust the amount of ink deposited on the paper.  If you have chosen the
correct paper type and are getting ink bleeding through the paper
or puddling, try reducing the density to the lowest value you
can while still achieving solid black.  If black is not solid
black, even with the contrast and brightness at 1.0, try increasing
the density.  Note that changes to this setting will not be visible in
the image preview.
    </para>
    <para>
All of the supported printers actually need less than 100% ink
density in most cases, so the actual density is something other than
the nominal density setting.  The effective density setting cannot go
above 100%, so if a value specified will result in an excessively high
density level, it will be silently limited to a setting of 1.0.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Gamma</title>
    <para>
Adjust the gamma of the image, over and above the printer-specific
correction.  Gamma less than 1.0 will result in a darker image; gamma
greater than 1.0 will result in a lighter image.  Unlike brightness,
gamma adjustment does not change the endpoints; it merely changes the
shape of the input->output curve.
    </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4><title>Dither Algorithm</title>
    <para>
The recommended dither algorithm is <guimenuitem>Adaptive
Hybrid</guimenuitem> (which is the default) for text or other fine
black detail, or if this is mixed with continuous tone images.  The
<guimenuitem>Ordered</guimenuitem> dithering algorithm is just as good
(and somewhat faster) for pure continuous-tone images and photographs,
but may yield poor results with text or other fine detail,
particularly at high printing resolutions.
    </para>
    <para> The <guimenuitem>Fast</guimenuitem> algorithm gives the
fastest results at the expense of color accuracy.  It is a simplified
ordered dither.  On simple four color printers (or other printers used
in four color mode), the quality is similar to
<guimenuitem>Ordered</guimenuitem>, although dark gray rendition is
not as good due to a simpler transfer between black and colored ink.
With six-color printers, color rendition is somewhat worse, but it
should be quite usable in cases where optimum quality is not critical.
In black and white, it is an efficient way to render grayscale, but it
may not give best results when used with variable dot size printers
(modern Epson printers, or Canon printers using DMT).  On rare three
color printers (CMY only) the results should be identical to ordered
dither.
    </para>
    <para> <guimenuitem>Very Fast</guimenuitem> is even faster than
<guimenuitem>Fast</guimenuitem>, with even more loss of quality.
Color and grayscale output will show strong patterning that resembles
screening, although it isn't.  On laser printers, and possibly on
certain kinds of text and line art, <guimenuitem>Very
Fast</guimenuitem> dithering may actually yield the best quality.
    </para>
    <para>
Error diffusion algorithms (<guimenuitem>Hybrid
Floyd-Steinberg</guimenuitem> is such an algorithm) perform very well
at high densities, and are capable of
rendering very fine detail rather well, but they tend to exhibit artifacts in
the form of "waves" or "worms" of dots which results in noticeable
texturing in pale areas.  Furthermore, pale areas immediately adjacent
to white take a while to "build up" sufficient error to print at all.
This is sometimes called "tearing" or "waterfalling".
    </para>

    <sect4><title>Set Defaults and Close</title>
    <para>
      When the <guibutton>Set Defaults</guibutton> button is clicked,
the slider bar settings will return to their default values.  The
dither algorithm setting is uneffected.  The <guilabel>Print Color
Adjust</guilabel> window will close when the

 <chapter><title>CUPS and Gimp-Print</title>
   <sect1><title>Introduction</title>
     <para>
       CUPS is an acronym which stands for <emphasis>C</emphasis>ommon
<emphasis>U</emphasis>nix <emphasis>P</emphasis>rinting
<emphasis>S</emphasis>ystem.  It is assumed that the reader has
properly installed the CUPS software and the Gimp-Print software.
This section will discuss adding a printer to CUPS that uses a
Gimp-Print printer driver, as well as how to modify the various
settings supplied by Gimp-Print. This will be a rather quick
explanation, as the CUPS software is quite well documented, and it is
not my intention to attempt to duplicate the CUPS documentation here.

   <title>Caution Regarding USB Printers</title>

   <para>
CUPS versions 1.1.11 and later <emphasis>REQUIRE</emphasis>
the user to insure that the desired USB printer is powered on
<emphasis>AND</emphasis> physically connected to the USB bus
<emphasis>BEFORE</emphasis> starting the CUPS software.  
   </para>
   <para>
CUPS must see the USB printer when the software starts.  The CUPS software
is typically started when the computer boots.  Note that one cannot
simply plug in the USB printer and power it on after CUPS has started.
(Note that this does not apply to parallel port printers).
   </para>
   <para>
If the USB printer was not connected and powered on at the time CUPS was
started, there will not be a USB printer shown in the
list of devices on the CUPS Admin Device Window (see 
<xref linkend="fig-cups-admin-device">).  In this event, stop the CUPS
software, properly connect and power on the USB printer, and restart
the CUPS software.
   </para>
   <para>
From the list of devices shown in the CUPS Admin Device Window
(see <xref linkend="fig-cups-admin-device">), a clever user might
attempt to avoid this issue by selecting 
<guimenuitem>Internet Printing Protocol</guimenuitem> 
and then enter something similar to 'usb:/dev/usblp0' in the next
screen.  However, this fails later in the configuration process with a
"client_error_not_possible" error message with no other explanation.
Note that entering 'file:/dev/usblp0' will not work either. While CUPS
will allow this, printing will not actually work in some situations.
   </para>
   <para>
CUPS versions 1.1.10 and earlier exhibit similar behavior with regard
to not displaying the USB printer if it was not connected to the USB
bus and powered up prior to starting the CUPS software.  However,
these versions of CUPS will indeed allow the user to enter the name of
the USB connection, unlike versions 1.1.11 and later.
   </para>
   </caution>

   <para>
Select the manufacturer of your printer and click the
<guibutton>Continue</guibutton> button.  A window will appear which
asks you to select the specific model number for your printer.
   </para>

   <para>
Scroll through the long list and find the model number for your
printer.  Notice carefully that there are many different languages
supported for each printer, as denoted by the initials in parenthesis.

   <sect1><title>Using CUPS from the Command Line</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to use the CUPS printing system from the command
line.  While this document will not delve into all of the specifics of
the CUPS command line interface, there are portions of this interface
which are specific to the Gimp-Print software.
   </para>

   <para>
The command line is in some cases a more convenient way to generate
printed output (e.g. when printing from a script).  However, most
people (including the author) cannot easily predict what a command
line option of "-o stpCyan=1350" will do to the output.  It is
therefore a good idea to use the GIMP to view the image and the
Gimp-Print plugin to preview these settings before relying on the
command line.
   </para>

   <para>
When using CUPS from the command line, the command will have this
general format:

   <programlisting>
   <![ CDATA [
     lpr -P my_printer_name \
         -o option1=<choice1> \
         -o option2=<choice2> \
         /path/to/printfile
     ]]>
   </programlisting>

When typing the command directly onto the command line, put all of the
command line options on one line, and do not type the "\" characters.
The list of possible options which are specific to Gimp-Print,
followed by some of the supported choices, are shown below:

   <programlisting>
   <![ CDATA [
   -o PageSize=<...| A3 | A4 | A4 | ...>
   -o InputSlot=<Roll | Standard>
   -o MediaType=< ..| Inkjet | Plain | GlossyPaper | ...>

  <sect1 label="0">
    <title>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="1">
    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="2">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if

      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was

      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's

      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve all the

      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>

    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>

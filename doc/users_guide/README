The files contained in this directory are all of the source files necessary 
to build "The User's Guide to the Gimp-Print Top Quality Printer Drivers".

Type:  make pdf   - to build the PDF documentation file
       make ps    - to build the Postscript documentation file
       make html  - to build the HTML documentation files
       make docs  - to build all of the documentation files

This is what will be generated:

	users_guide.ps
	users_guide.pdf
	html/book1.html

The generation of these file causes alot of text output on the terminal.
You will see messages like this, which you can safely ignore:

  jade:../users_guide.sgml:22:77:E: end tag for element "XREF" which is not open

You will also see messages from LaTeX regarding undefined references.  This 
can also be safely ignored.  

The documentation contains many color screenshots.  My goal was to have the 
documentation print acceptably at 360 DPI.  However, I realize that not everybody 
has a color printer.  For those people, such as the owners of laser printers, 
I'd like to suggest printing the documentation in greyscale.  Printing the 
documentation in black and white will results in unacceptable quality for many 
of the screenshots.

All of the figures are contained in the "figures" subdirectory.  Read the
figures/README file if you are interested in how I created the 
screenshots used throughout the documentation.

All of the HTML files are contained in the "html" subdirectory.

Your constructive feedback is most welcome.

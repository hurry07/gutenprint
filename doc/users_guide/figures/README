Here's how I created the screen dumps shown in the documentation
================================================================

0) Bring up the interesting window to be dumped

1) Bring up the GIMP

2) In the GIMP, select File...Acquire...ScreenShot

3) Click on the interesting window to be dumped

4) Select File...SaveAs, PNG, and the file name

5) Select File...SaveAs, Postscript, and select
   encapsulated postscript.

The postscript file is needed for generating the final .ps file.
The PNG file is needed for the HTML output.

The image scaling is done in the DocBook source code contained in
gimp-print-users-guide-<rev>.sgml

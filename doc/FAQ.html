<h2>Gimp-Print FAQ</h2>

<ol>

<p><li><h3>Is it only for Gimp?</h3>

<p>No, it can be used for many printing needs. Gimp-print started out
as a driver for The Gimp, the well known image manipulation program.
Early in development versions for Ghostscript and later CUPS were
added.  The emphasis is still on quality color printing, though
performance gets a lot of attention these days.
 
<p><li><h3>I cannot install it, it complains about missing Gimp files</h3>

<ul>

<p><li>If you have the Gimp installed on your system, you probably
have the user package, but not the development package, installed.
You will need to install the latter from your installation media; it's
usually named gimp-devel.

<p><li>If you don't have the Gimp installed on your system, you need
to pass <tt>configure</tt> the option <tt>--with-gimp=no</tt>, so it
won't try to look for the Gimp and fail.

</ul>

<p><li><h3>What is the difference between B/W, Line art, solid color and
Photo mode (or ImageType in Ghostscript)?</h3>

<p>Photo mode does a lot of work to make colors as similar to screen
presentation as possible.  This takes time. The other modes are
faster, but colors may be off.  B/W mode does not use color ink when
printing.

<p><li><h3>I selected my printer and it doesn't work at all</h3>

<p>Please check your printing system (lpd, CUPS, LPRng, etc.)
configuration.

<p><li><h3>I selected the right printer and nonsense gets printed</h3>

<p>Printers for which support just has been added may not have been
tested, as the developers do not have access to the printer. It is
worth trying different settings. For example, change the resolution to
a mainstream value as used on that printer. Also photo mode is better
tested than the optimized versions. When you find out what works and
what doesn't, file a bug report.

<p>One common cause of this is not using "raw" mode when printing from
the Gimp plugin.  Depending upon your printing system, you will need
to use either -l (traditional BSD lpd), -oraw (CUPS lpr), or -d (most
versions of System V lp, including CUPS).  Otherwise the printing
system attempts to interpret the output as something else, and tries
to apply a filter to it to convert it to something else (usually
PostScript).
  
<p><li><h3>What's up with the HP Deskjet 1200?</h3>

<p>HP had sold two printers with the 1200 model designation. The old
version is 300 DPI and has a heating element to dry the ink. It was
manufactured around 1990.  The new version is of 2000 vintage and has
higher resolution.  The one supported by this package is the new
one???

<p><li><h3>I selected the right printer and the quality is lousy</h3>

<p>Try selecting a different resolution or quality setting. Especially
lower resolutions have a problem putting enough ink on paper. Also,
use Photo mode.  If you find settings that do not work, report these
as bugs.  High resolutions should produce a similar (but smoother)
result than medium resolutions. Resolutions under a certain printer
dependent figure are seen as draft-only - for example lower than 360
DPI on Epsons with standard paper or lower than 300 DPI on HP.

<p>If you use Ghostscript, make sure the Ghostscript resolution is not
set higher than the driver resolution. If it is higher, the driver has
to throw away part of the pixels, leading to uneven strokes in text
and slanted lines with interruptions.

<p><li><h3>What is 'interpolated' resolution?</h3>

<p>Interpolated resolution is an experimental way of simulating higher
resolution than the printer offers by calculating the result at high
resolution but printing at the maximum resolution offered by the
printer.  In our experience, when the dither algorithm is working
properly this merely results in longer processing time and more
voluminous output with little or no improvement in quality.

<p><li><h3>How do I start setting options for Ghostscript?</h3>

<p>Please see src/ghost/README for more information.

<p><li><h3><tt>escputil -i</tt> or <tt>escputil -d</tt> fails as follows:</h3>

<p><pre>
% escputil -r /dev/lp0 -i

[ ... license info omitted ... ]

Cannot read from /dev/lp0: Invalid argument
</pre>

<p>You need to rebuild your kernel with CONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK
enabled.

<p><li><h3>My USB-connected Epson Stylus printer won't work with
{Free,Net,Open}BSD!</h3>

<p>By default, the BSD device driver for the USB printer device (usually
ulpt0) does a prime, or USB bus reset, when the device is opened.  This
causes the printer to reset itself (one can hear the print head moving back
and forth when this happens) and lose sync.  After this the printer
won't go into graphics mode and instead spews characters all over you
expensive photo paper.  This has been observed on the Stylus Photo
870; it likely exists with other USB-connected Epson Stylus printers.

<p>The fix is to use the "unlpt0" device instead of "ulpt0".  The driver
doesn't perform the USB prime when unlpt is opened.  If this device
doesn't exist on your system you can create it with 

<p><pre>mknod unlpt0 c 113 64 root wheel</pre>

<p>in the /dev directory.

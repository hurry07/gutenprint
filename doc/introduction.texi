@cindex how to read
This manual documents the use of the GIMP-Print package, focusing mainly on the
libgimpprint library that is the core of GIMP-Print. Parts of the manual which
describe the use of libgimpprint are aimed primarily at programmers, and do
assume that the reader is familiar with C programming, and using standard
programming tools on GNU or UNIX systems. Other parts of the manual document
the use of the programs that make up the GIMP-Print package, and assuse no
knowledge other than the basics of using a shell and editor.

The best way to learn how to use libgimpprint in your own programs is to read
the manual from start to finish, using the examples given in the text to learn
how it works. The bulk of the manual can be used as a reference once one
understands the basics.
